Once a jolly swagman camp'd by a billabong under the shade of a coollibah tree and he sang as he watch'd and waited till his billy boiled You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me. Waltzing Matilda Waltzing Matilda you'll come a waltzing Matilda with me and he sang as he watched and waited till his billy boiled you'll come a waltzing Matilda with me.Down came a jumbuck to drink at the water hole Up jumped the swag man and grabbed him with glee and he sang as he stowed him away in his tucker bag You'll come a waltzing Matilda with me
