In my sweet little Alice blue gown, When I first wandered down into town, I was both proud and shy As I felt evry eye, But in evry shop window I'd primp passing by, Then in manner of fashion I'd frown And the world seemed to smile all around, Till it wilted I wore it, I'll always adore it, My sweet little Alice Blue Gown. In my Gown.
