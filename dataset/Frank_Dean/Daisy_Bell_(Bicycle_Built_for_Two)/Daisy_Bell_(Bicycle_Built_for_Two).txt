There is a flower Within my heart, Daisy, Daisy! Planted one day By a glancing dart, Planted by Daisy Bell! Whether she loves me Or loves me not, Sometimes it's hard to tell; Yet I am longing to share the lot Of beautiful Daisy Bell! Dai sy, Daisy, Give me your answer do! I'm half crazy, all for the love of you! It won't be a stylish marriage, I can't afford a carriage, But you'll look sweet upon the seat of a bicycle made for two.We will go tandem as man and wife, Daisy, Daisy! Peddling away down the road of life, I and my Daisy Bell! When the road's dark we can both despise policemen and 'lamps' as well. There are bright lights in the dazzling eyes of beautiful Daisy Bell!I will stand by you in wheel or woe, Daisy, Daisy! You'll be the bell which I'll ring you know! Sweet little Daisysy Bell! You'll take the lead in each trip we take, then if I don't do well I will permit you to use the brake, my beautiful Daisy Bell!
