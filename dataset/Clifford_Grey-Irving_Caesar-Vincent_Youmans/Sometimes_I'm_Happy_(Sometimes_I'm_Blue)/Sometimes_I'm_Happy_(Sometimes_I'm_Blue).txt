Sometimes I'm Happy, sometimes I'm blue my disposition depends on you. I never mind the rain from the skiesc if I can find the sun in your eyes. Sometimes I love you, sometimes I hate you; but when I hate you, it's 'cause I love you. That's how I am, so what can I do? I'm happy when I'm with you you.
