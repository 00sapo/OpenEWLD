Nothing's impossible I have found, for when my chin is on the ground, I pick myself up, Dust myself off, Start all over again. Don't lose your confidence if you slip, be grateful for a pleasant trip, And pick yourself up, Dust yourself off, start all over again, Work like a soul inspired till the battle of the day is won, You may be sick and tired, But you'll be a man, my son! take a deep breath, Pick yourself up, Dust yourself off, Start all over
