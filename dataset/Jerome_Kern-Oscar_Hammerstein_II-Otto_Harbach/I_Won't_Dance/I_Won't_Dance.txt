(He)  I won't dance! Don't ask me; I won't dance! Don't ask me; I won't dance, madame, with you. My heart won't let my feet do things they should do! You know what? You're lovely! (she)  and so what? I'm loverly! (He)  But, oh! what you do to me. I'm like an ocean wave that's bumped on the shore; I feel so absolutely stumped on the floor! (She)  When you dance you're charming and you're gentle 'spec ially when you do the "Continental." (He)  But this feeling isn't purely mental; for heaven rest us, I'm not asbestos. And that's why I won't dance! Why should I? I won't dance! How could I? I won't dance! "Mer ci beau coup" I know the music leads the way to romance so if I hold you in my arms I won't dance!
