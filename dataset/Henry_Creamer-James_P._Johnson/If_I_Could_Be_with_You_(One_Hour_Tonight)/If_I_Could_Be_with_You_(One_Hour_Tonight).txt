I'm so blue I don't know what to do; All day thru I'm pining just for you. I did wrong when I let you go away, For now I grieve about you night and day. I'm unhappy and dissatis fied, But I'd be happy if I had you by my side. If I could be with you I'd love you strong, If I could be with you I'd love you long I want you to know I would'nt go Until I told you honey why I love you so. If I could be with you one hour tonnight, If I was free to do the things I might I telling you true I'd be anything but blue If I could be with you. If I could you.
