I'm in a nice bit of trouble, I confess, Somebody with me has had a game, I should by now be a proud and happy bride, But I've still got to keep my single name. I was proposed to by Obadiah Binks, In a very gentle manly way, Lent him all my money so that he could buy the home, And punctually at twelve o' clock today. There was I waiting at the church, waiting at the church waiting at the church, When I found he'd left me in the lurch, Lor' how it did upset me! All at once he sent me round a note, Here's the very note, This is what he wrote, Can't get away to marry you today My wife won't let me! let me.Lor', what a fuss Obadiah made of me, When he used to take me in the park! He used to squeeze me till I was black and blue, When he kissed me he used to leave a mark. Each time he met me he treated me to wine, Took me now and then to see the play; Understand me rightly, when I say he treated me, It wasn't him but me that used to pay.Just think of how disapointed I must feel, I'll be going crazy very soon. I've lost my husband the one I never had! And I dreamed so about the honeymoon! I'm looking out for another O badiah, I've already bought the wedding ring, all my little falthe riddles packed up in my box Yes, absolutely two of ev'ry thing.
