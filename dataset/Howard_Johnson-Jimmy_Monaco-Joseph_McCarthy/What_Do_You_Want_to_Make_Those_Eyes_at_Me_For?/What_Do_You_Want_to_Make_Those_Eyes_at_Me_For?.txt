Funniest pair of eyes I've ever seen, Funny I can't get wise to what they mean, I wish that I can understand the things they say, Each time I try to go, they seem to make me stay. Maybe, it's just because you love to flirt, Maybe you want to see my feelings hurt, You've got me running 'round you like a child, Some day you're goin' to drive me wild. So, what do you want to make those eyes at me for, When they don't mean what they say? They make me glad, they make me sad, They make me want a lot of things I've never had. So what do you want to fool around with me for? You lead me on, and then you run away, But, never mind I'll get you alone some night and then you'll surely find, You're flirting with dynamite, So what do you want to make those eyes at me for, When they don't mean what they say? so what do you say?Why don't you try to make your eyes behave, They seem to make me act just like a slave, For when they say to run away, I've always found The chances are, they mean that I should stick around. Tho' I admit your eyes are full of charm, Somehow I feel they mean to do me harm, Some day if I don't answer when they call, You'll have to blame your eyes, that's all.
