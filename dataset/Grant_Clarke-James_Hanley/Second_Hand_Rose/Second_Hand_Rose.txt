I'm wearing second hand hats second hand clothes that's why they call me second band Rose Even our piano in the parlor, Father bought for ten cents on a dollar. Second hand pearls, I'm weraing second hand curls. I never get a single things that's new. Even Jake the plumber, he's the man I adore, had the nerve to tell me he's been married before. Ev'ryone knows that I'm just Second Hand Rose from Second Avenue. I'm wearing ue.second hand shoes, second hand hose; all the girls hand me*their secondhand beaux. Even my pajamas when I don them. have somebody else's 'nitials on 'em Second hand rings, I'm sick of second hand things. I never get what other girlies do. Once while strolling thru the Ritz a girl got my goat, she*nudged her friend and said "Oh! look their's my old fur coat."
