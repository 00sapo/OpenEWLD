Last night I lay a sleeping, chang'd, There came a dream so fair, I stood in old Jerusalem Beside the temple there. I heard the children singing y, and ever as they sang, methe thought the voice of Anagels From Heav'n in answer rang; Methe thought the voice of Anagels From Heav'n in answer rang, Jerusalem! Je rusalem Lift up your gates and sing, Hosanna inthe highest! Hosanna to your King! And once again the scene was chang'd, New earth there seem'd to be, I saw the Holy City Beside the tideless sea; The light of God was on its streets, The gates were open wide, And all who would might enter, And noone was denied. No need of moon or stars by night, or sun to shine by day, It was the new Jerusalem That would not pass away, It was the new Jerusalem That would not pass away. Jerusa lem! Jerusalem! Sing for the night is o'er Hosanna in the highest, Hosanna for evermore!Hosanna in the highest, Hosanna for everthen methought my dream was THe streets no longer rang, Hush'd were the glad Hosannas The little children sang. The sun grew dark with mysterThe morn was cold and chill, As Shadow of a cross rose upon a lonely hill, As shadow of a cross rose upon a lonely hill Je rusa lem! Jerusalem! Hark! how the Angels hill Hosanna inthe highest, Hosanna to your King.
