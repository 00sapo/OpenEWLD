Some think the world is made for fun and frolic and so do I and so do I some think it well to be all melancholic to pine and sigh to pine and sigh But I I love to spend my time in singingsome joyous song some joyous song to set the air with music bravely ringing is far from wrong is far from wrong Listen listen echoes sound afar listen listen echoes sound afar Funiculi funicula funiculi funicula echoes sound afar Funnicupa funicula
