In a little Spanish town, twas on a night like this stars were peekabooing down twas on a night like this I whispered be true to me and she sighed Si Si many skies have turned to gray because we're far apart Many moons have passed away and still she's in my heart we made a promise and sealed it with a kiss In a little Spanish town twas on a night like this.
