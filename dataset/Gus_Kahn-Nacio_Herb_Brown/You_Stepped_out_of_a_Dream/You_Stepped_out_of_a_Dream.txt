You stepped out of a dread. You are too wonderful to be what you seem. Could there be eyes like your? Could there be lips like your? Could there be smiles like your? honest and truely?You stepped out of a cloud. I want to take you away, away from the crowd, and have you all to myself alone and apart out of a dream, safe in my heart.
