Listen to yo' daddy warn you, 'Fore you start a travelin' Woman may born you, love you and mourn you, But a woman is a sometime thing Yes, a woman is a sometime thing. Yo' Mammy is the first to name you, An' she'll tie you to her apron string. Then she'll shame you and she'll blame you till yo' woman comes to claim you 'Cause a woman is a sometime thing, Yes a woman is a sometime thing. Don't you never let a wo man grieve you Jus' 'cause she got yo' weddin' ring. She'll love you an' deceive you then she'll take yo' clo'es an' leave you. 'Cause a woman is a sometime thing Yes a woman is a sometime thing, Yes a woman is a sometime thing, Yes a woman is a sometime thing. Ah!
