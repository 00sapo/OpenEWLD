Summertiime and the livin' is easy Fish are jumpin' and the cotton is high, Oh, your daddy's rich, and your ma is goodlookin' So hush, little baby, don't you cry. One of these mornin's You're goin' to rise up singin' Then you'll spread your wings and you'll take the sky. But till that mornin' there's a nothin' can harm you With Daddy and Mammy standin' by.
