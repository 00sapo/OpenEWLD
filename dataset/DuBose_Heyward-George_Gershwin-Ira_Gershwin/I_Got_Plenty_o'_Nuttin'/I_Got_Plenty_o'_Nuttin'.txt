I got plenty o' nuttin' and nuttin´s plenty for me. Oh, got no car, got no mule, got no misery. The folks with plenty o' nuttin´ they gotta lock on the door. Oh, ´fraid somebody going to rob ´em while there's outa making more, what for? I got no lock on the door, that's no way to be. They can steal the rug from the floor, that's okay with me, 'cause the things that I'll prize like the stars in the sky's all are free. I got plenty o' nuttin' and nuttin's plenty for me. Oh, got my girl, got my song, got heaven the whole day long. Got my girl. Got my song. Got my lord. Got my song.I got plenty o' nuttin' and nuttin's plenty for me. Oh, got the sun, got the moon, got the deep blue sea. The folks with plenty o' plenty, they got to pray all the day. Oh, seems with plenty, you got to worry, to keep the devil away. I ain't frightend about hell, 'til my time arrives. Never worry long as i'm well. Never one to strive, to be good, to be bad, what the hell, I am glad, I'm alive. I got plenty o' nuttin' and nuttin's plenty for me. Oh, got my man, got my song, got heaven the whole day long. Got my man. Got my song. Got my lord. Got ma song.
