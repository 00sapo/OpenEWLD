Down yonder green valley where streamlets ley meander when twilight is the fading I pensivly rove, or at the bright moon tide in solitude wander amid the dark shades of the lonely ash grove. 'Twas there while the black bird was cheerfully singing, I first met that dear, one the joy of my heart, Around us for gladness, the blue bells were springing Ah! lit'neath tle though I how soon we should part.Still glows the bright sunshine o'er valand mounttain still war Bless black bird its notes from the tree, still tremble the moonbeam on steamlet and fountain, but what are the beauties of nature to me. With sorrow, deep sorrow, my bosom is lader, all day I go mourning in search of my love, Ye echoes Oh tell me, where is the sweet maiden, She sleeps the green turf down by the ash groove.
