An- gels, we have heard on high, Sweet- ly sing- ing o'er the plains. And the moun- tains in re- ply, Which inspire your joyous strains, "Glo- ri- a, In ex- cel- sis De- o, Glori- a, In ex- cel- sis De- o."Shep- ards why this ju- bilee? Why your joy- ous strains prolong What the glad- some tid- ings be, Echo- ing their heavenly song?"
