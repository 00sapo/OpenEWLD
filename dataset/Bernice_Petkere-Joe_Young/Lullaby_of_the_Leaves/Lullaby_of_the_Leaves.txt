Cradle me where southern skies can watch me with a million eyes, Oh sing me to sleep, Lullaby Of The Leaves. Cover me with heaven's blue and let me dream a dream or two, Oh sing me to sleep, Lullaby Of The Leaves. I'm breezing along, along with the breeze, I'm hearing a song, a song thru the trees, ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh The pine melody caressing the shore, Familar to me, I've heard it before, ooh ooh ooh ooh. That's southland, don't I feel it in my soul, and don't I know I've reached my goal, Oh sing me to sleep, Lullaby Of The Leaves.
