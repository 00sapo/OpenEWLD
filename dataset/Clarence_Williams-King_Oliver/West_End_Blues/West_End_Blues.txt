I got the blues from my head to my shoes. I'm blue today. I've got a mean evil feelin' my belly's full of gin. I'm on my way to the West End, and that's where troubles will begin. My gal, my pal, low down mean houn' they're in town, they're cuttin' it up. Yes, they're runnin' 'round. Soon I'm gonna take a walk and knock upon her door Now those folks in West End, They're gonna see some shootin' like they never saw before, My gal and my best pal will never cheat in West End any more. I got the way to the West End to lose those West End Blues.
