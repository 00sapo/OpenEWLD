Gee! It's great, after bein' out late, Walkin' My Baby Back Home. Arm in arm, over meadow and farm, Walkin' My Baby Back Home. We go 'long harmonizin' a song, or I'm reciting a poem. Owls go by, and they give me the eye, Walkin' My Baby Back Home. We stop for a while, she gives me to park, and snuggles her head to my chest. We start in to pet, And that's when I get her talcum all over my vest After I kinda straighten my tie, she has to borrow my comb. One kiss then I continue again, Walkin' My Baby Back Home Home.She's 'fraid of the dark, so I have to park, outside of her door till it's light. She says if I try to kiss her, she'll cry. I dry her tears all thru the night. Hand in hand to a barbecue stand, right from her doorway we roam. Eats! and then it's a pleasure again,
