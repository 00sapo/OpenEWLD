All day long you're asking me what I see in you, all day long I'm answering, but what good does it do? I have nothing to explain. I just love you, love you, and I'll tell you once again. I don't know why I love you like I do, I don't know why, I just do. I don't know why, you thrill me like you do. I don.t know why you just do. You never seem to want my romancing, the only time you hold me is when we're dancing. I don.t know why I love you like I do. I don't know why, I just do. do.
