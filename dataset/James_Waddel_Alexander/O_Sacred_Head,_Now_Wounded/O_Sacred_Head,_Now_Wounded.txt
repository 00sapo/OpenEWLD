1. O sacred head, now wounded, With grief and shame weighed down Now scornfully surrounded With thorns, Thine only crown. O sacred head, what glory, What bliss till now was Thine! Yet, tho' despised and gory, I joy to call Thee mine.2. What Thou, my Lord, has suffered Was all for sinners' gain. Mine, mine was the transgression, But Thine the deadly pain. Lo, here I fall, my Savior; 'Tis I deserve thy place. Look on me with thy favor; Vouchsafe to me Thy grace.3. What language shall I borrow To thank Thee, dearest friend, For this, Thy dying sorrow, Thy pity without end? O make me Thine forever, And, should I fainting be, Lord let me never, never, Outlive my love to Thee.
