Hush a bye my baby slumber time is coming soon Rest your head upon my breast while Mammy hums a tune the sandman is calling where shadows are falling the soft breezes sigh as in days gone by Way down in Missouri where I heard the melody when I was a little child uponmy Mammys knee theold folks were humming the banjos were strumming so sweet and low.
