When I was a boy my mother often said to me, Get married boy and see, how happy you will be. I have looked all over, but no girlie can I find, Who seems to be just like the little girl I have in mind, I will have to look around until the right one I have found. I want a girl, just like the girl that married dear old Dad, She was a pearl and the only girl that Daddy ever had, A good old fashioned girl with heart so true, One who loves nobody else but you, I want a girl just like the girl that married dear old Dad. Dad.
