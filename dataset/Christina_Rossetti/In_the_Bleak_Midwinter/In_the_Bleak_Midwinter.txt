God, In the bleak midwinter, frosty wind made moan, earth stood hard as iaron, water like a stone. Snow had fallen, snow on snow, a snow ble on sufsnow, the in the bleak midwinter, long, long ago.heaven cannot hold him, nor the earth sustain; heav'n and earth shall flee raway when He comes to reign. In the bleak midwinter staher place den ficed: Yet Lord shipped God amighty, Jesus Christ.Angels and archangels may have gathered there, cherubbim adh sephim throngwould ed the air. But His mother only, in would maimy bliss, worthe belovec with a kiss.What can I give him, poor as I am? If I were shep herd, I bring a lamb. If I were a wise man, I do part. what can I give Him: give my heart.
