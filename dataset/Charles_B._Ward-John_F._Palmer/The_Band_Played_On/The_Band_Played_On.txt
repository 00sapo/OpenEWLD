Casey would waltz with a strawberry blonde, and the band played on, He'd glide 'cross the floor with the girl he ador'd and the band played on. But his brain was so loaded it nearly exploded, The poor girl would shake with alarm. He'd ne'er leave the girl with the strawberry curl, And the band played on. on.
