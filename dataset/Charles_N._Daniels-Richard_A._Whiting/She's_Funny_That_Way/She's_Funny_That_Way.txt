I'm not much to look at, nothin' to see, just glad I'm livin' and lucky to be, I got a woman crazy for me, She's funny that way. I can't save a dollar, ain't worth a cent, she doesn't holer, she'd live in a tent, I got a woman crazy for me, She's funny that way. Tho' she loves to work and slave for me ev'ry day, she'd be so much better off if I went away but, why should I leave her, Why should I go she'd be unhappy with out me I know, I got a woman crazy for me, She's funny that way. I She's funny that way.never had nothin', no one to care, that's why I seem to have more than my share, I got a woman crazy for me, she's funny that way. When I hurt her feelings, once in a while, her only answer is one little smile, I got a woman crazy for me, She's funny that way. I can see no other way and no better plan, end it all and let her go to some better man; but I'm only human, coward at best, I'm more than certain she'd follow me west, I got a woman crazy for me,
