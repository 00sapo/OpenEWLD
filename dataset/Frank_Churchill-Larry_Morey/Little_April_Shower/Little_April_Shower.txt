Drip, drip, drop little April shower, beating a tune as you fall all around. Drip, drip, drop little April shower, what can compare with your beautiful sound. Drip, drip, drop when the sky is cloudy, your pretty music can brighten the day. Drip, drip, drop when the sun says "Howdy," you say "Goodbye" right away. Drip, drip, drop little April shower, beating a tune ev'rywhere that you fall. Drip, drip, drop little April shower, I'm getting wet and I do't care at all. Drip! Drop! Drip! Drip! I'll never be afraid of a good little gay little April serenade.
