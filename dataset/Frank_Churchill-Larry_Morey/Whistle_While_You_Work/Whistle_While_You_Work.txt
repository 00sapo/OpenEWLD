Just Whistle While You Work. (whistle) Put on that grin and start right in, To whistle loud and long. Just hum a merry tune. (hum) Just do your best, Then take a rest, And sing yourself a song. When there's too much to do, Don't let it bother you, Forget your trouble, Try to be just like the cheerful chickadee, And Whistle While You Work. (whistle) Come on, get smart, Tune up and start, To Whistle While You Work.
