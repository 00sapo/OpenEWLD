In the shade of the old apple tree where the love in your eyes I could see when the voice that I heard, like the song of the bird seemed to whisper sweet music to me I could hear the dull buzz of the bee In the blossoms as you said to me with a heart that is true I'll be waiting for you in the shade of the old apple tree
