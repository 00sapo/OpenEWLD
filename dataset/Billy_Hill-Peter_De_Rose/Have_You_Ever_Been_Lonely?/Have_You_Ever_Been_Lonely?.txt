Have you ever been lonely? Have you ever been blue? Have you ever loved someone? Just as I love you? Can't you see I'm sorry, for each mistake I made? Can't you see I've changed, dear, Can't you see I've paid? Be a little forgiving take be back in your heart, How can I go on living, now that we're apart. If you knew what I've been thru, You would know why I ask you, Have you never been lonely? Have you ever been blue? Have you ever been blue.
