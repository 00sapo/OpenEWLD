I heard the bells on Christmas day Their old familiar carols play, And wild and sweet the words repeat Of peace on earth goodwill to men!I thought how, as the day had come The belfries of all Christendom Had rolled along th' unbroken song Of peace on earth good will to men!Then pealed the bells more loud and deep: "God is not dead, nor doth not sleep! The wrong shall fail, the right prevail With peace on earth good will to men!And in despair I bowed my head: There is no peace on earth," I said; "For hate is strong and mocks the song, Of peace on earth good will to men!Till ringing, singing on its way, The world revolved from night to day, A voice, a chime, a chant sublime Of peace on earth good will to men!
