Ol' Man River, dat Ol' Man River, He must know sumpin' but don't say nothin' He jus' keeps rollin', He keeps on rollin' along. He don't plant 'taters, he don't plant cotton, An' dem dat plants 'em is soon forgotten; But Ol' Man River, he jus' keeps rollin' along. You an' me, we sweat an' strain, Body all achin' an' racked wid pain. "Tote dat barge!" "Lift dat bale," Git a little drunk an' you land in jail. Ah gits weary an' sick of tryin', Ah'm tired of livin' An' skeered of dyin', But Ol' Man River, he jus' keeps rollin' along. long.
