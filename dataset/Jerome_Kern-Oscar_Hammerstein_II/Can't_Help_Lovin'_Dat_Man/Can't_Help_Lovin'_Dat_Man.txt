Fish got to swim and birds got to fly I got to love one man till I die Can't help lov in' dat man of mine. Tell me he's la zy tell me he's slow, tell me I'm cra zy may be I know, Can't help lov in' dat man of mine. When he goes a way dat's a rainy day, and when he comes back dat day is fine, the sun will shine He can come home as late as can be, home without him aint no home to me, Can't help lovin' dat man of mine.
