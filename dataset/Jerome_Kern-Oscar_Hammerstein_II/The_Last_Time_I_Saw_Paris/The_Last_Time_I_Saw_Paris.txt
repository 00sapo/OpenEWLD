The last time I saw Paris her heart was warm and gay, I heard the laughter of her heart in evry street cafe. The last time I saw Paris her trees were dressed for spring and lovers walked beneath those trees and birds found songs to sing I dodged the same old taxi cabs that I had dodged for years, the chorus of the squeaky horns was music to my ears the last time I saw Paris her heart was warm and gay No matter how they change her I'll remember her that way.
