I've told evry little star just how sweet I think you are why haven't I told you I've told ripples in a brook made my heart an open book why haven't I told you Friends ask me am I in love I always answer yes, might as well confess if I dont they guess Maybe you may know it too oh my darling if you do why haven't you told me,
