I hear music when I look at you, a beautiful theme of ev'ry dream I ever knew, Down deep in my heart I hear it play, I feel it start, then melt away. I hear music when I touch your hand, a beautiful melody from some enchanted land, Down deep in my heart I hear it say Is this the day? I alone have heard this lovely strain, I alone have heard this glad refrain, Must it be forever inside of me, why can't I let it go, why can't I let you know, Why can't I let you know the song my heart would sing? That beautiful rhapsody of love and youth and spring, The music is sweet, The words are true, The song is you.
