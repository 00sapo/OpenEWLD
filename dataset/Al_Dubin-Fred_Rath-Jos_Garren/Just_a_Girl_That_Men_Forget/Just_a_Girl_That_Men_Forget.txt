Dear little girl, they call you a Vamp, A flapper with uptodate ways You may shine brightly but just like a lamp, You'll burn out one of these days. Then your old fashioned sister will come into view, With a husband and kiddies, But what about you? You're the kind of a girl that men forget, Just a toy to enjoy for a while, For when men settle down they always get an old fashioned girl, With an old fashioned smile, And you'll soon realise you're not so wise, When the years bring you tears of regret. When they play "Here comes the bride" you'll stand outside, Just A Girl That Men Forget. You're theWall flower girl now dry all those tears, For you won't be left all alone. Someday you'll find yourself upon a throne, Queen of a sweey little home. And you gay little flapper, you'll live and you'll learn, When you've gone down the pathway that has no return.
