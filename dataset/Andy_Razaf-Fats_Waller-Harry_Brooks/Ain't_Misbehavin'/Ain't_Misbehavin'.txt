No one to talk with, all by myself, No one to walk with, but I'm happy on the shelf, Ain't misbehavin' I'm savin' my love for you you Like Jack Horner in the corner don't go nowhere, what do I care, Your kisses are worth waitin' for, believe me I don't stay out late, don't care to go, I'm home about eight, just me and my radio Ain't misbehavin' I'm savin' my love for you.
