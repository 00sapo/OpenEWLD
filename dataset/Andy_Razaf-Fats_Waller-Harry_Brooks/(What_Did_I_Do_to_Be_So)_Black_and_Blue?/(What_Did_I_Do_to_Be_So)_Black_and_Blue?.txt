Cold empty bed springs hard as lead, Pains in my head, feel like old Ned, What did I do to be so black and blue.? No joys for me, no company, Even the mouse ran from my house. All my life thru, I've been so black and blue. I'm white in side, but that don't help my case, 'Cause I can't hide what is on my face, ooh! I'm so forlorn, life's just a thorn, My heart is torn, why was I born? What did I do to be so black and blue?
