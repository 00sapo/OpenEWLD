The night is young and you're so beautiful, here among the shadows, beautiful lady, open your heart. The scene is set, the breezes sing of it: can't you get into the swing of it, lady when do we start? When the lady is kissable and the evening is cool, any dream is permissable in the heart of a fool. The moon is high and you're so glamorous, and if I seem over amorous, lady, what can I do? The night is young and I'm in love with you.
