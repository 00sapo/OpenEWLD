But along came Bill who's not the type at all you'd meet him on the street and never notice him his form and face his manly grace are not the kind that you would find in a statue and I can't explain it's surely not his brain that makes me thrill. I love him because he's wonderful because he's just old Bill he's just my Bill an or dinary boy he hasn't got a thing that I can brag about and yet to be upon his knee so comfy and roomy feels natural to me and I can't explain it's surely not his brain that makes me thrill I love him because he's I don't know because he's just my Bill
