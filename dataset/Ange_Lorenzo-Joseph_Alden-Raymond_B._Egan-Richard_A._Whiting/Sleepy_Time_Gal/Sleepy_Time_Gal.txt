Sleepy time gal, you're turning night into day, Sleepy time gal, You've danced the ev'ning away, Before each silvery star Fades out of sight, Please give me one little kiss, Then let us whisper "Goodnight." It's gettin' late, and dear, your pillow's waitin'; Sleepy time gal, When all your dancin' is thru, Sleepy time gal, I'll find a cottage for you, You'll learn to cook and to sew, What's more you'll love it, I know, Whe you're a stayathome play at home, eightoclock, sleepy time gal. gal.
