Two little children on morning, after their breakfast was o'er. Were laughing and playing together alone on the dining room floor. The girl of a dream hnad been talking, but refused with a toss of her head To tell it all to her playmate, until he coaxingly said. You had a dream, Well I had one too. I know mine's best, 'Cause it was of you. Come sweetheart tell me, now is the time. You tell me your dream, I'll tell you mine.
