Oh once I was happy but now I'm forlorn like an old coat that is tattered and torn left in this wide world to fret and to mourn betrayed by a maid in her teens oh the girl that I loved she was handsome and I tried all I knew her to please but I could not please her one quarter so well as the man on the flying trapeze Oh! he'd fly thro' the air with the greatest of ease a daring young man on the flying trapeze his movements were graceful all girls he could please and my love he purloined away.
