1. There's a song in the land of the lilly Each sweetheart has heard with a sigh. O ver high garden walls this sweet echo falls As a soldier boy whispers goodbye: Smile the while you kiss me sad adieu When the clouds roll by I'll come to you. Then the skies will seem more blue, Down in Lover's Lane, my dearie. Wedd ing bells will ring so merrily Ev'ry tear will be a memory. So wait and pray each night for me Till we meet again. 2 Tho'2. bye means the birth of a tear drop, Hel lo means the birth of a smile. And the smile will erase the tear blighting trace, When we meet in the after awhile.
