Moon shinin' on the river. Come along, my Liza! Breeze singin' thru the treetops. Come along, my Liza! Somethin' mighty sweet I want to whisper sweet and low, That you ought to know, my Liza! I get lonesome, honey, When I'm all alone so long; Don't make me wait; don't hesitate; come and hear my song. Liza, Liza, skies are gray, But if you'll smile on me All the clouds'll roll away. Liza, Liza, don't delay, Come, keep me company And the clouds'll roll away. See the honeymoon ashinin' down; We should mak a date with Parson Brown. So, Liza, Liza, name the day When you belong to me And the clouds'll roll away. way.
