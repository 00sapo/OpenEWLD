If you lis ten, I'll sing you a sweet little song Of a flower the's now drooped and dead, Yet I dearer to me, yes than all of its mates, Tho have each holds aloft its proud head 'Twas given to me by a girl that I know; Since we've met, faith, I've known no repose. She is dearer by far than the world's brightest star, And I call her my wild Irish rose. My wild Irish rose, the sweetest flow'r that grows, You may search ev'rywhere, but none can compare with my wild Irish rose. My wild Irish rose, the dearest flow'r that grows, And some day for my sake, she may let me take the bloom from my wild Irish rose. They may rose.sing of their roses which by other names, Would smell just as sweetly, they say, But know that my Rose would never consent To that sweet name taken away. Her glances are shy when e'er she passes by The bower where my true love grows. And my one wish has been that some day I may win The heart of my wild Irish rose.
