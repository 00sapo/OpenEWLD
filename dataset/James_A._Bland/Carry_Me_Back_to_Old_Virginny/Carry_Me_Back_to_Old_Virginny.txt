Carry me back to old Virginny, there's where the cotton and the corn and 'tatoes grow. There's where the birds warble sweet in the springtime, There's where this old darkey's heart am long'd to go, There's where I la bor'd so hard for old Massa, Day after day in the fields of yel low corn. No place on earth do I love more sincerely Than old Virginny, the state where I was born.
