Thanks a million, a million thanks to you, For ev'rything that love could bring you brought me. Each tender loveword you happened to say, Is hidden away, In mem'ry's bouquet. Thanks a million, for I remember too, the tenderness that your caresses taught me. You made a million dreams come true and so I'ms saying thanks a million to you. you.
