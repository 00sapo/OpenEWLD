The moon was all aglow and heaven was in your eyes, The night that you told me those little white lies. The stars all seemed to know that you didn't mean all those sighs, The night that you told me those little white lies. I try but there's no forget ting when ev'ning ap pears I sigh but there's no regretting in spite of my tears. The Devil was in your heart, But heaven was in your eyes., The night that you told me Those little white lies. The lies!
