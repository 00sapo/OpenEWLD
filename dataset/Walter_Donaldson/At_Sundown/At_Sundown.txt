Ev'ry little breeze is sighing of love undying at sundown. Ev'ry little bird is resting and feather nesting at sun down. Each little roesbud is sleeping While shadows are creeping. In a little cottage cozy the world seems rosy at sundown. Where a loving smile will greet me and always meet me at sundown, I seem to sigh, I.m in heaven, When night is falling and love is calling me home.
