If I should lose you the stars would fall from the sky. If I should lose you the leaves would wither and die. The birds in Maytime would sing a mournful refrain and I would wander around hating the sound of rain. With you beside me the rose would bloom in the snow. With you beside me no winds of winter would blow. I gave you my love and I was living a dream, but living would seem in vain if I lost you. If I should you.
