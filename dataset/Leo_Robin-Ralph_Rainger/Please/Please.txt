Please lend your little ear to my pleas, Lend a ray of cheer to my pleas, Tell me that youy love me too. Please, let me hold you tight in my arms, I could find delight in your charms, Ev'ry nightt my whole live through. Your eyes reveal that you have the soul of an angel, white as snow; But how long must I play the role of a gloomy Romeo? Oh! Please say you're not intending to tease, Speed the happy ending and please, Tell me that you love me too.(the nicest man I've met;) (tearful Juliet?)
