It's June in January because I'm in love. It always is spring in my heart, with you in my arms. The snow is just white blossoms that fall from above; and here is the reasonmy dear, your magical charms. The night is cold, the trees are bare, but I can feel the scent of roses in the air. It's June in January because I'm in love, but only because I'm in love with you. It's you.
