The end has come, my heart is numb, 'twas like a bolt from the blue above. I can't believe it but you are gone, darling, and here lies love. The sky is dark, I hear a lark, he sounds as sad as a mouunful dove. The dew appears like the tears of dawn, darling for here lies love. All my dreams lost beyond recall, dreams of spring blasted in the fall; you gave lips, you gave arms, I gave all! I ought to cry, my eyes are dry; there's only one thing I'm conscious of, I only know that I can't go on, darling, for here lies love.
