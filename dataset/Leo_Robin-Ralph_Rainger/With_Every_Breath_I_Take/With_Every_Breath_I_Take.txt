I think of you with ev'ry breath I take, and ev'ry breath becomes a sigh, not a sigh of dispair, but a sigh that I care for you. I hear your name with ev'ry breath I take, on ev'ry breeze that wanders by and your name is a song I'll remember the long years through. Even tho' I walk alone, you guide me. In the darkness you light my way, and all the while inside me love seems to say: "Someday, someday!" And when I sleep you keep my heart awake, but when I wake from dreams divine ev'ry breath that I take is a pray'r that I'll make you mine.
