There's Me and a few o' my cronies one or two pals o' my ain We went into a hotel and we did very welland then we came out once again Then we went into another And that is the reason I'm fu' We had six deoch and dorus and then sang a chorus Just listen I'll sing it to you I belong to Glasgow Dear old Glasgow town What's the matter wi' Glasgow for it's going round and round I'm onlya common old working chap as anyone here can see but when I get a coupleo' drinks on a Saturday Glasgow belongs to me.no wrong in being teetotal or saving a shilling or twoIf your money you spend Then you've nothing to lend Well that's all the better for you Ther's no harmin taking a droppie It ends all your trouble and strife It givesyou the feeling that when you get home You won't give a hang for the wife
