And when I told them how beautiful you are They didn't believe me they didn't believe me your lips your eyes your cheeks your hair are in a class beyond compare you're the loveliest girl that one could see And when I tell them and I certn'ly am goin' to tell them that I'm the man whose wife one day you'll be they'll never believe me they'll never believe me that from this great big world you've chosen me!
