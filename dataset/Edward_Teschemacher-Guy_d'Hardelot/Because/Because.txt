Because you come to me with naught save love abd hole my hand and lift mine eyes above a wider world of hope and joy I see because you come to me because you speak to me in accents sweet I find the roses waking at my feet and I am led thru tears and joy to thee because you speak to me because God made thee mine I'll cherish thee thru light and darkness thru all time to be and pray His love may make our love divine because God made thee mine
