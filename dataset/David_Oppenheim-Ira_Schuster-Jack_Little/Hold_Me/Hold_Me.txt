When you're near me I feel so romantic. When you're far away I'm always blue. If you want me to remain romantic, here are all the things you'll have to do. Hold me, honey wont you hold me. Hold me, never let me go. Take me, honey won't you take me. Never to fosake me, 'Cause I love you so. Thrill, me, let your kisses thrill me, Just like, you alone can do. Hold me, tnederly enfold me, Never try to hold me, from you. you.
