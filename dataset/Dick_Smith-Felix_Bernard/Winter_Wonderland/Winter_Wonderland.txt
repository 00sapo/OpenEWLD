Sleigh bells ring are you listning in the lane snow is glist ning a beauti ful sight we're happy tonight walking in a winter wonderland Gone away is the bluebird here to stay is the new bird to sing his love song as we go along walking in a winter wonderland In the meadow we will build a snowman and pretend that he is Par son Brown He'll say are you married? We'll say no man but you can do the job when you're in town later on we'll conspire as we sit by the fire to face unafraid the plans that we made walking in a winter wonderland,
