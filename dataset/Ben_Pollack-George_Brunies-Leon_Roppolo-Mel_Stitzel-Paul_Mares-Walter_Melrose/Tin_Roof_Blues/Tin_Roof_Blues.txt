I have seen the bright lights burning up and down old Broadway. Seen 'em in gay Havana, Burmingham Alabama, and say, they just can't compare with my hometown, New Orleans. 'Cause there you'll find the old Tin Roof Cafe, where they play the blues till break of day. Fascinatin' babies hangin' 'round, dancin' to the meanest band in town. Lawd, how they can play the blues, and when the leader man starts playin' low, folks get up and start to walk it slow. Do a lot of movements hard to beat. Till that old floorman says "Move your feet," Lawd, I've go thoes Tin Roof Blues.
