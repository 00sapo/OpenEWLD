You've got to give a little, take a little, and let your poor heart break a little. That's the story of, that's the glory of love. You've got to laugh a little, cry a little before the clouds roll by a little. That's the story of that's the glory of love. As long as there's the two of us we've got the world and all it's charms. And when the world is through with us, we've got each others arms. You've got to win a little, lose a little, and always have the blues a little. That's the story of that's the glory of love. You've got to love.
