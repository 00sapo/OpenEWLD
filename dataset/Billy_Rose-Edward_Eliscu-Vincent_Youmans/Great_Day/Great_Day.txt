When you're down and out Lift up your head and shout "There's gonna be a great day." Angels in the sky Promise that bye and bye There's gonna be a great day. Gabriel will warn you Some early morn you will hear his horn rootty tootin. It's not far away Hold up your hands and say, "There's gonna be a great day."
