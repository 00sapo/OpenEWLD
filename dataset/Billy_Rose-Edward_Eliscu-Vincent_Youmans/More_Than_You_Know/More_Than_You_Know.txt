More Than You Know, More Than You Know, man o' my heart, I love you so. Lately I find you're on my mind, More Than You Know. Whether you're right whether you're wrong, man o' my heart, I'll string along. You need me so more than you'll ever know. Loving you the way that I do there's nothing I can do about it; loving may be all you can give but honey I can't live without it Oh, how I'd cry, oh, how I'd cry, if you got tired and said "goodbye", more than I'd show more than I'd ever know. More Than You Know.
