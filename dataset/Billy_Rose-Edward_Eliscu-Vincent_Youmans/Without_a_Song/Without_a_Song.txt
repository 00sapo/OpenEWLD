Without a song the day would never end, Without a song the road would never bend, When things go wrong a man ain't got a friend, Without a song. That field of corn would never see a plough, That field of corn would be a desert now, A darky's born, But he's no good nohow without a song. I got my troubles and woe but sure as I know the Jordan will roll, I'll get along as long as a song is strong in my soul. I'll never know what makes the rain to fall, I'll never know what makes the grass so tall, I on ly know there ain't no love at all without a song. (Instrumental) I only know there ain't no love at all without a song.
