You'll always find me near the man with the horn. Find me there from dusk until dawn. That's the place where mu sic is born divine. Just listen while he takes his so fine. So sweetly, He plays and says it so well. Completly I'm under his spell. So if you're in the mood for music and love, just forget the stars up above. And my friend you'll find you'll be drawn to the man with the horn.solo apart. Watch him close his eyes from the start. Hear that music pour from his heart.
