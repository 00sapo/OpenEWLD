Yes we'll rally round the flag, boys, we'll rally once again, Shouting the battlecry of Freedom, We will rally from the hillside, we'll gather from the plain, Shouting the battlecry of Freedom. The Union forever! Hurrah boys, Hurrah! Down with the traitor, Up with the star; While we rally round the flag, boys, Rally once again, Shouting the battlecry of Freedom.We are springing to the call of our Brothers gone before, Shouting the battlecry of Freedom, And we'll fill the vacant ranks with a million freemen more, Shouting the battlecry of Freedom.We will welcome to our numbers the loyal true and brave, Shouting the battlecry of Freedom, And altho' he may be poor he shall never be a slave, Shouting the battlecry of Freedom.So we're springing to the call from the East and from the West, Shouting the battlecry of Freedom, And we'll hurl the rebel crew from the land we love the best, Shouting the battlecry of Freedom.
