I remember all my life raining down as cold as ice shadows of a man a face through the window crying in the night the night goes into see a memry I never realized how happy you made me Oh Mandy well you came and you gave without taking but I sent you away Oh Mandy well you kissed me and stopped me from shaking and I need you roday Oh Mandy I"m Mandy yesterdays a dream I face the morning crying on a breeze the pain is calling Oh Mandy well you came and you gave without taking but I sent you away Oh Mandy well you kissed me and stopped me from shaking and I need you today OhMornings just another day happy people pass my way Looking in their eyes I uphill climbing the tears are in my mind and bothing is rhyming D.S.al
