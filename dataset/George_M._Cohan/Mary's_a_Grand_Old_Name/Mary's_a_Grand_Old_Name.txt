My mother's name was Mary, she was so good and true; Be cause her name was Mary, she called me Mary too. She wasn't gay or airy, but plain as she could be; I hate to meet a fairy who calls herself Marie. For it is Ma ry, Mary, plain as any name can be. But with propriety society will say Marie. But it was Mary, Mary, long before the fashions came, And there is something there that sounds so square, It's a grand old name. For it is name.Now, when her name is Mary, there is no falsehood there; When to Marrie she'll vary, she'll surely bleach her hair. Though Mary's ordinary, Marie is fair to see; Don't ever fear sweet Mary, beware of sweet Marie.
