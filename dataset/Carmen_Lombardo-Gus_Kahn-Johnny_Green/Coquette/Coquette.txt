Tell me why you keep foolin there little coquette making fun of the one fun of the one who loves you Breaking hearts you are ruling now little coquette true hearts that are dreaming tenderly dreaming of you some day you'll fall in love as I fell in love with you maybe the one you love will just be foolin' and when you're all alone withe all your regrets you know little coquette you will know that I love you
