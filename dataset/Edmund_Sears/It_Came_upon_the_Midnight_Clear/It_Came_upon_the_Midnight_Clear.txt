It came upon the midnight clear, That gloious song of old, From angels bending near the earth To touch their harps of gold. "Peace on the earth, good will to men, From heav'ns all gracious King." The world in solemn stillnes lay To hear the angels sing.Still thru the cloven skies they came, With peaceful wings unfurl'd And still their heav'nly music floats O'er all the weary world. Above its sad and lowlly plains They bend on hov'ring wing. And ever o'er it's Babel sound The blessed angels sing.Forl lo the days are hast'ning on, By prophets seen of old, When with the ever circling years Shall come the time foretold. When the new heav'n and earth shall own The Prince of Peace, their king, And  the whole of world send back the song Which now the angels sing.
