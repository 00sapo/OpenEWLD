When I take my sugar to tea, All the boys are jealous of me. 'Cause I never take her where the gang goes, When I take my sugar to tea. I'm a rowdy dowdy, that's me, She's a highhat baby, that's she. So I never take her where the gang goes. When I take my sugar to tea. Ev'ry Sunday afternoon We forget about our cares. Rubbing elbows ar the Ritz, With those millionaires, When I take my sugar to tea, I'm as Ritzy as I can be. 'Cause I never take her where the gan goes, When I take my sugar to tea. When I tea.
