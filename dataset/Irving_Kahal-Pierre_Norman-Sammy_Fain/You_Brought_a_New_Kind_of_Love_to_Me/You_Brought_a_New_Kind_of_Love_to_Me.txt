If the nightingales could sing like you, They'd sing much sweeter than they do, For you've brought a new kind of love to me. If the sandman brought me dreams of you, I'd want to sleep my whole life thru, For you've brought a new kind of love to me. I know that I'm the slave, you're my queen, But still you can understand, That underneath it all you're a maid and I am only a man. I would work and slave, The whole day thru, If I could hurry home to you, For you've brought a new kind of love to me If I me.
