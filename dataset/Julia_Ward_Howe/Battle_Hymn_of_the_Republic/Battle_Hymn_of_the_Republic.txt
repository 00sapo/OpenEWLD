Mine eyes have sdeen the glory of the coming of the Lord he is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored, he hath loosed the fatefullightning of his terrible swift sword his truth is marching on Glo ry glory hallelujah glory glory hallelujah glory glory hallelu jah his truth is marching on I have seen him in the watchfires of a hundred circling camps they have builded him an al tar in the evening dews and damps, I can read his righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps his day is marching on Glory glory hallelujah glory glory hallelujah glory glory hallelujah his truth is marching on.
