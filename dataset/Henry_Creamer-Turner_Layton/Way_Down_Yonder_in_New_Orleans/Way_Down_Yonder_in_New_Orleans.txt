Way down yonder in New Orleans, In the land of dreamy scenes Ther's a garden of Eden, That's what I mean, Creole babies with flashing eyes. Softly whisper with tender sighs, "Stop! Oh! won't you give you lady fair a little smile. Stop! You bet your life you'll linger there. a little while." There is Heaven right here on earth With those beautiful queens, Way down yonder in New Orleans.
