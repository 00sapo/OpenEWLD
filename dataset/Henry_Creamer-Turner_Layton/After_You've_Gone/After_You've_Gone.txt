After you've gone and left me crying, After you've gone, there's no denying, You'll feel blue, you'll feel sad, You'll miss the dearest pal you've ever had. There'll come a time, now don't forget it, There'll come a time when you'll regret it. Some day, when you grow lonely,Your heart will break like mine and you'll want me only; After you've gone, after you've goneAfter you've gone, after we break up, After you've gone, you're gonna wake up. You will find you were blind To let somebody come and change your mind. After the years we've been together, Through joy and tears, all kinds of weather, Some day, blue and downhearted, You'll long to be with me right back where we started; After you've gone, after you've gone
