Oh, Johnny! Oh, Johnny! how you can love! Oh! Johnny! Oh, Johnny! Heavens above! You make my sad heart jump with joy, And when you're near I just can't sit still a minute, I'm so, Oh, Johnny! Oh, Johnny! Please tell me, dear, What makes me love you so? You're not handsome, it's true, But when I look at you, I just, Oh, Johnny! Oh, Johnny!
