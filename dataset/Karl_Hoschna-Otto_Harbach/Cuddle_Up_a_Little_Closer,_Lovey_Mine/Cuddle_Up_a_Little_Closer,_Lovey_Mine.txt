Sitting here before the embers, Watching pictures fade and glow. Seem as tho' the fire remembers, Scenes of the long ago. You with golden ringlets streaming; Dressed in knickers there am I; Just two kiddies lost in dreaming As we hum this lullaby. Cuddle up a little closer, Lovey mine. Cuddle up and be my little clinging vine. Like to feel you cheeks so rosy, Like to make you comfy cozy, 'Cause I love from head to toesy Lovey mine. mine.
