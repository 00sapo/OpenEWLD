Tell me you feel good today, tell me that I should stay, tell me you want to say something from your heart Show me your sparklingeyes, tease me, make my spirits rise, Hold me 'til I realize I cannot bear to be so far apart, take a little walk with me, sing a Gershwin melody, Rain may fall eventually, but we'll make a sunny start, so tell me you feel good today, tell me that I should stay, tell me you want to say something from your, something from your, something from your heart.
