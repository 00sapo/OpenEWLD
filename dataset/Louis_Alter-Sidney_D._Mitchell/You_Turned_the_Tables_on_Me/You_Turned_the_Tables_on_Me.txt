You turned the tables on me, and now I'm falling for you. You turned the tables on me, I can't believe that it's true. I always thought when you brought the lovely presents you brought why hadn't you brought me more. But now if you come I'd welcome anything from the five and ten cent store. You used to call me the top; you put me up on a throne. You let me fall with a drop and now I'm out on my own. But after thinking it over and over, I got what was coming to me. Just like the sting of a bee you turned the tables on me.
