I'd rather be a sparrow than a snail yes I would if I could I surely would Hmm I'd rather be a hammer than a nail Yes I would if I only could I surely would Hmm Away I'd rather sail away like a swan thats here and gone A man gets tied up to the ground He gives the world its saddest sound its sad dest soundrather be a forest than a street I'd rather feel the earth beneath my feet.
