Who's sorry now? Whose heart is aching for breaking each vow? Who's sad and blue? Who's crying too? Just like I cried over you. Right to the end, just like a friend, I tried to warn you somehow. You had your way, now you must pay; I'm glad that you're sorry now. Alnow.2. (Al)though I forgive you, I cannot forget, how you shattered all my ideals. You smiled when I told you that you would regret, and now you know just how it feels.
