The holly and the ivy when they are both fullgrown of all the trees that are in the wood, the holly bears the crown. the rising of the sun and the running of the deer The playing of the merry organ sweet singing in the choirThe Holly bears a blossom as white as lily flow'r and Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ to be our sweet savior.The Holly bears a berry As red as any blood and Mary bore sweet Jesus Christ to do poor sinners good.
