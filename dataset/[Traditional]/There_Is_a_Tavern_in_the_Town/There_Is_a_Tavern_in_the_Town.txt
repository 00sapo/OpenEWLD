There is a tavern in the town, in the town, and there my true love sits him down sits him down and drinks his wine mid laugh ter free and never never thinks of me thinks of me, Fare thee well for I must leave thee do not let this parting grieve me and remember that the best of friends must part, must part Adieu adieu kind friends adieu adieu adieu I can no longer stay with you stay with you I'll hang my harp on a weeping willow tree and may the world go well with thee.
