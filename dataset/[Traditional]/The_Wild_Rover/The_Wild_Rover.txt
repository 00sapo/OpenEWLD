I've went been a wild rover for many a year, And I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer, But now I'm returning with gold in great store, And I never will play the wild rover no more. And it's no, nay, never, No, nay, never no more Will I play the wild rover, No, never no more.I out into an ale house I used to frequent, And I told the landlady my money was spent, I asked for a bottle; she answered me "Nay, Such a custom as yours I can get any day."Then go of my pocket I took sovereigns bright, And the landlady's eyes opened wide with delight. She said, "I have whiskies and wines of the best, And the words that I said, sure, were only in jest."I'll back to my parents, confess what I've done, And ask them to pardon their prodigal son. And if they caress me as oftimes before, Then I never will play the wild rover no more.
