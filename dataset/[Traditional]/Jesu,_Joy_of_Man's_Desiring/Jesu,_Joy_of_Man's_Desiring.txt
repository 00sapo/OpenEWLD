1. Jesu, joy of man's desiring, Holy wisdom, love most bright, Drawn by Thee, our souls aspiring Soar to uncreated light. Word of God our flesh that fashioned With the fire of life impassioned. Striving still to Truth unknown, Soaring,, dying round Thy Throne.2. Thru the way where hope is guiding, Hark, what peaceful music rings! Where the flock, in Thee's confiding, Drink of joy from deathless springs. Their's is beauty's fairest pleasure, Their's is wisdom's holiest treasure. Thou dost ever lead Thine own, In the love of joys unknown.
