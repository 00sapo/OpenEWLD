Frankie and Johnny were sweethearts. Oh, what a couple in love! Franlie was loyal to Johnny, just as true as stars aabove. He was her man, but he done her wrong. This is the end of my story and this is the end of my song. Frankie is down in the jailhouse and she cries the whold night long "He was my man and he done me wrong."
