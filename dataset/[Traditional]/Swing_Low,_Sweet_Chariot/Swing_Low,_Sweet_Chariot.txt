Swing low sweet chariot, Comin' for to carry me home. Swing low, sweet chariot, Comin' for to carry me home. I look over Jordan and what did I see, Comin for to carry me home? A band of angels comin' after me, Comin' for to carry me home. Swing low sweet chari ot, Comin' for to carry me home. Swing low sweet chari ot, Comin' for to carry me home.
