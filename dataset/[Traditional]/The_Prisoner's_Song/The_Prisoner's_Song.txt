Oh I wish I had someone to love me, Somemeet one to night call me their own, Oh I wish I had someone to live with, For I'm tired of living alone.Oh, please meet me tonight in the moonlight, Please ing me towith all aalone, For I have a sad story to tell you, It's a story that's never been told.I'll be carried to the new jail tomorrow, Leaver my poor on darling and lone, With the cold prison bars all around me, And my head on a pillow of stone.Now I have a brand ship on the ocean, All mounted silver would gold, And before my poor darling would suffer, Oh that shop would be anchored and sold.Now if I had the wings o9f an angel, Ovthese priswalls I fly, And I'd fly to the arms of my poor darling, And there I'd be willing to die.
