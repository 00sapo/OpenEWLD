1. Cheeks as red as the bloomin rose, Eyes of the deepest brown You are the darling of my heart, Stay till the sun goes down. Shady Grove, my litttle love Shady Grove I know, Shady Grove, my little love, Bound for the Shady Grove.2. Peaches in to the summer time, Apples a in the fall, If I can't get the girl I love Won't have want none at all.3. When I was a lit tle boy, I wanted of whitlin' knife Now I'm 'rya I'd great big boy, An' I that me a wife.4. Wish I had a banjo string Made come here golden twine, And evhere time fidpick on it, I'd wish here girl were mine.5. Some come here fiddle and dance, Some around to tarry, Some come to my dle and dance, I come drive to Marmy.6. Fly around my blueeyed girl, Fly my daisy, Fly around blue eyed girl, Nearly me crazy.
