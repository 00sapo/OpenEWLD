Good people all this Chtristmas time, Consider well and bear in mind, What our good God for us has done, in sending His beloved Son. With Mary holy we should pray to God with love this Christmas Day; In Bethlehem upon that morn, There was a blessed Messiah born.The night before that happy tide, The noble Virgin and her guide Were long time seeking up and down to find a lodging in the town. But mark how all things came to pass: From ev'ry door repelled Alas! As long foretold their refuge all Was but a humble ox's stall.Let all you songs and praises be, Unto His Heav'nly Majesty; and evermore amongst our mirth, Remember Christ ou Savior's birth. That night the Virgin Mary mild, Was safe deliver'd of a child; According unto Heav'n's decree, Man's sweet salva tion for to be.
