I saw three ships y come sailing in On Christmas Day, on christmas Day, I saw three ships y come sailin in On Christmas Day in the morningAnd what was in those ships all three On Christmas Day on Christmas Day, And what was in those ships all three On Christmas Day in the morning?The Virgin Marand Christ were there O Christmas Day on Chirstmas Day; The Virgin Marand Christ were there On Chirstmas Day in the morning.
