O moon whose mystic veil from the skies falling gilds sighing wavelets pale to our hearts calling Zephyrs are ne'eer at rest o'er the sea bringing coolness to brow and beast far away singing Glorious the summer night seastrand and billows white San ta Lu cia Santa Lucia Glorious the summmer night seastrand and billows white SantaLucia Santa Lucia.
