1. In Dub lin's fair city, where girls are so pretty, I first set my eyes on sweet Molly Malone. As she pushed her wheelbarrow thru streets broad and narrow singing, "Cockles! and Mussels, alive, alive oh!" Alive, alive oh, alive, alive oh, singing "Cockles and Mussels alive alive oh!" 2. She oh!" 3. She oh!"2. was a fish monger, but sure 'twas no wonder, for so were her father and mother before. And they each whheeled their barrow thru streets broad and narrow singing "Cockles and Mussels alive, alive oh!"3. died of a fever, and no one could save her, and that was the end of sweet Molly Malone. But her ghost wheels her barrow thru streets broad and narrow singing "Cockles and Mussels alive, alive oh!"
