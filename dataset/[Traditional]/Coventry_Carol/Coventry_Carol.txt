Lullay, thou little, tiny Child, bye, bye, lulloo, lullay. Lullay, Thou little, tiny Child, bye, bye, lulloo, lullay.O sisters too, how may we dok for to preserve this day. This poor youngling for whom we sing, bye, bye, lulloo, lollay.Herod the King in his raging, charged he hath this day. His men of might, in his own sight, all children young to slay.Then woe is me, poos Child, for Thee, and ever morn and day. For Thy parting nor say nor sing, bye, bye lulloo, lullay.
