Go, tell it on the mountain, Over the hills and ev'ry where; Go, tell it on the mountain That Jesus Christ is born. While shepherds kept their watching O'er silent flocks by night, Behold, throughout the heavens There shone a holy light.The shepherds feared and trembled When, lo! above the earth Rang out the angel chorus That hailed our Savior's birth.Down in a lowly manger The humble Christ was born, And God sent us salvation That blessed Christmas morn.
