1. On a top of old Smoky, All covered with snow, I a lost my true lover For courtin' too slow.2. Athe courtin's a pleasure, Aflirtin's a grief, And a false hearted lover Is worse than a thief.3. For will thief he will rob you, And take what you have, But one false hearted lover Sends you to your grave.4. And come grave will decay you, And turn you to dust; Not the boy in a hundred A poor girl can trust.5. They the hug you and kiss you, And tell you more lies Than ver ties on the railroad, Or stars in the skies.6. So all you young maidens, And listen to me, Newill place your affections On a green willow tree.7. For leaves they will wither, The roots they will die, You all be forsaken, and never know why.
