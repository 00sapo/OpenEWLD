You made me love you; I didnt want to do it, I didnt want to do it You made me want you; and all the time you knew it, I guess you always knew it You made me happy sometimes, you made me glad But there were times, dear, you made me feel so sad You made me sigh, for I didn't want to tell you, I didn't want to tell you I want some love, that's true, yes I do 'Deed I do, you know I do Give me, give me what I cry for; You know you got the brand of kisses that I'd die for You know you made me love you
