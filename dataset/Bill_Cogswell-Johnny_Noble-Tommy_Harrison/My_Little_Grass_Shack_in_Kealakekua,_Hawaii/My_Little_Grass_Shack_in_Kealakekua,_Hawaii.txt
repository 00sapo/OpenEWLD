I wanna go back to my litle grass shack in Kealakekua, Hawaii. I want to be with all the kanes and wahines that I knew long ago. I can hear old guitars aplaying, on the beach at Hoonaunau. I can hear the Hawiians saying, "Komomai no kaua ika hale welakahao" it won't be long 'til my ship will be sailing back to Kona A grand old place that's always fair to see. I'm just a little Hawiian and a homesick Island boy, I want to go back to my fish and poi, I want to go back to my little grass shack in Ke a lakekua, Hawaii. Where the Humuhumunukunuku a puaa goes swimming by. Where the Humuhumunukunuku a puaa goes swimming by.
