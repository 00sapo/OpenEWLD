I wished on the moon for something I never knew, wished on the moon for more than I ever knew: a sweeter rose, a softer sky, an April day that would not dance away, I begged of a star to throw me a beam or two, wished on a star and asked for a dream or two. I looked for ev'ry loveliness, it all came true; I wished on the moon for you.
