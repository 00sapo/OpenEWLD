Did I remember to tell you I adore you, And I am lliving for you alone? Did I remember to say, "I'm lost without you," And just how mad about you I've grown? you were in my arms and that was all I kne we were alone we two, What did I say to you? Did I remember to tell you I adore you, And pray forevermore you are mine?
