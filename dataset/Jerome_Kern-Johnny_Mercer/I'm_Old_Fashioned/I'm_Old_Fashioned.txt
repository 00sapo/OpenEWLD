I'm Old Fashioned, I love the moonlight, I love the old fashioned thing; the sound of rain up on a windowpane, the starry song that April sings. This year's fancies are passing fancies, but sighing sigs, holding hands there my heart understands. I'm Old Fashioned, but I don't mind it. That's how I want to be as long as you agree to stay old fashioned with me.
