Rose Of Washington Square, I'm withering there in basement air I'm fading, Pose with plain or fancy clothes, they say my Roman nose it seems to please artistic people. Beaux I've plenty of those, with second hand clothes and nice long hair. I've got those Broadway vampires lashed to the mast, I've got no future but, oh, what a past. I'm Rose Of Washington
