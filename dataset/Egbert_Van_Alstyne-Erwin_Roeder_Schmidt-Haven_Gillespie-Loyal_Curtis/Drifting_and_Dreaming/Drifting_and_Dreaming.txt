Down by the southern sea. There at Waikiki. Someone waits for me Beneath the dreamy summer moon. Hearts are all in time. Lovers softly croon Their plaintive melodies of love. Drifting and dreaming While shadows fall Softly at twilight I hear you call. Love's old sweet story, told with your eyes.. Drifting and dreaming Sweet paradise.Far, far away in dreams. Where the moonlight gleams. There I stay it seems. And while my fancies come and go. One that I love so Whispers sweet and low. Come back to dreamy paradise.
