My life flows on in endless song; Above earth's lamentation, I hear the sweet, though far off hymn That hails a new creation. Through all the tumult and the strife, I hear the music ringing; It finds an echo in my soul. How can I keep from singing?What though my joys and comforts die? The Lord my Savior liveth. What though the darkness gather round? Songs in the night He giveth. No storm can shake my inmost calm While to that refuge clinging; Since Christ is Lord of Heav'n and earth, How can I keep from singing?I lift mine eyes; the cloud grows thin; I see the blue above it; And day by day this pathway smoothes, Since first I learned to love it: The peace of Christ makes fresh my heart, A fountain ever springing! All things are mine since I am His! How can I keep from singing?
