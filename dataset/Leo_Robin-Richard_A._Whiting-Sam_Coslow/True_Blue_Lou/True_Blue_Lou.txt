She was a dame in love with a guy, she stuck to him but didn't know why. Ev'ryone blamed her, still they all named her, True Blue Lou. He gave her nothing, she gave him all, but when he had his back to the wall, who fought to save him, smiled and forgave him? True Blue Lou. He got a break and went away, to get a new start, but, poor kid, she never got a break, except the one way down in her heart. Maybe somewhere in heaven above, there's a reward for that kine of love. Angels wont blame her, they too will name her True Blue Lou
