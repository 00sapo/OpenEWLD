Ev'ry little breeze seems to whisper "Louise." Birds in the trees seem to twitter "Louise." Each little rose tells me it knows I love you, love you. Ev'ry little beat that I feel in my heart, seems to repeat what I felt at the start. Each little sigh tells me that I adore you, Louise. Just to see and hear you brings joy I never knew. But to be so near you thrills me through and though. Any one can see why I wanted your kiss, it had to be but the wonder is this: Can't it be true someone like you could love me,
