Summer You old Indian Summer you're the tear that comes after June times laughter you see so many dreams that don't come true dreams we fashioned when summer time was new you are here to watch over some heart that is broken by a word that somebody left unspoken you're the ghost of a romance in June going astray fading too soon that's why I say farewell to you Indian summer.
