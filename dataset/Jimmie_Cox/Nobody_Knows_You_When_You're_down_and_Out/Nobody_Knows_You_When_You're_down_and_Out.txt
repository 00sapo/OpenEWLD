Once I lived the life of a millionaire; Spending my money, I didn't care. I took all my friends out for a good time, Buyin' high price liquor, champagne and wine. When I began to fall so low, I din't have a friend and no place to go. If I ever get hold of a dollar again, Gonna hold on to it till the eagle grins. Nobody knows you when you're down and out. In your pocket not one penny; And your friends, you haven't any. But if you ever get on your feet again, Then you'll find your long lost friends. It's mighty strange without a doubt; Nobody knows you when you're down and out. I mean when you're down and out.
