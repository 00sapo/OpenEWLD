It's a far croonin' that is pullin' me away as take I wi' my cromak to the road. The far Cuillands lins are puttin' love on me as step I wi' the sunlight for my load. Sure by Tunnel and Loch Rannoch and Loch Aber I will go, By heather tracks wi' heaven in their wiles. If it's thinkin' in your inner heart braggart's in my step you've never smelt the tangle o' the isles. Oh the far Cuillins areput putting love on me, As step I wi' my cromak to the Isles.It's the blue Islands that are pullin' me away as laughter puts the leap upon the lame, The blue isfrom the Skerries to the Lews, Wi' heather honey taste upon each name.
