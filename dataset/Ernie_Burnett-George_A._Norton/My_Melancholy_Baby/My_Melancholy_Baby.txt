Come sweetheart mine don't sit and pine tell me of the cares that make you feel so blue what have I done? Answer me hon have I ever said an unkind word to you? my love is true and just for you I'd do almost anything at any time dear when you sigh or when you cry, some thing seems to grip this very heart of mine Come to me my melancholy baby cuddle up and don't be blue all your fears are foolish fancy maybe you know dear that I'm in love with you Evry cloud must have a silver lining wait until the sun shines through Smile my honey dear while I kiss away each tear or else I shall be melancholy too. Now won't you tooBirds in the trees whispering breeze, should not fail to lull you into peaceful dreams so tell me why sadly you sigh sit ting at the window where the pale moon beams you shouldnt grieve try and believe life is always sunshine when the heart beats true Be of good cheer, smile thru your tears, when you're sad it makes me feel the same as you
