You ought to see Mister Jones when he rattles the bones, Old Colonel Brown foolin' round like a clown Miss Virginia who is past eighty three Shoutin' I'm full o' pep! Watch yo' step,! watch yo' step! One legged Joe danced aroun' on his toe, Threw away his crutch and hollered "Let 'er go!" Oh, honey, Hail! Hail! the gang's all here for an Alabama Jubilee.
