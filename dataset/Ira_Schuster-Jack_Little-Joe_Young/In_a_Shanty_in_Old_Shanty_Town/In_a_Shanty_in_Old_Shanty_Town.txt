It's only a shanty in old shanty town; the roof is so slanty it touches the ground. But my tumbled down shack by an old railroad track, like a millionaire's mansion, is calling me back. I'd give up a palace if I were a king; it's more than a palace it's my ev'rything. There's a queen waiting there with a silvery crown, in a shanty in old shanty town.
