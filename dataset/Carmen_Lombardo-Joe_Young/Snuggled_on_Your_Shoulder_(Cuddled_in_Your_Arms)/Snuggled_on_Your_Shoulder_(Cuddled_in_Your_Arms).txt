Snugled on your shoulder, Cuddled in you arms; Dreaming while I'm dancing, Thrilled by all your charms. While the muscis playing, I'm in ecstasy, Sweetheart, hear me saying, "This is heavenly. Dancing while lights are low, What a grand sensation. Dancing, You ought to know You're my inspiration. Let me dance forever, Dream about your charms, Snuggled on your shoulder, Cuddled in your arms.
