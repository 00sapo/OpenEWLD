I laughed the day I saw you leave, I laughed and said I'd never grieve, but AFTER MY LAUGHTER CAME TEARS. LAUGHTER CAME TEARS. My pride kept me from showing them that I was blue.

My lips concealed a heart in pain I made believe, but all in vain for AFTER MY LAUGHTER CAME TEARS.I told my friends I didn't care, I laughed about our whole affair, || || || || || || || ||
