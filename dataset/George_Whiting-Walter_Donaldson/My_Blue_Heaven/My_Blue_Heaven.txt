When whippoorwills call and evening is nigh I hurry to My Blue Heaven A turn to the right a little white light Will lead you to My Blue Heaven. You'll see a simling face, a fireplace, a cozy room, a little nest that's nestled where the roses bloom, Just Mollie and me And baby makes three, We're happy in My Blue Heaven.
