1. What Child is this, who laid to rest, On Mary's lap is sleeping? Whom angels greet with anthems sweet While shepherds watch are keeping? This, this is Christ the King, Whom shepherds guard and angels sing. Haste, haste to bring Him laud, the Babe, the Son of Mary. 2. Why Mary.(2. Why) lies He in such mean estate, Where ox and ass are feeding? Good Christian, fear for sinners here, The silent Word is pleading. 3. So(3. So) bring Him in cense, gold and myrrh; Come, peasant king to own him. The King of Kings salvation brings, Let loving hearts enthrone Him.
