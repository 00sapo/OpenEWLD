Your eyes of blue, your kisses too, never knew what they could do I cant believe that you're in love with me. You're telling ev'ryone I know, I'm on your mind each place you go, They can't believe that you're in love with me. I have always placed you far above me, I just can't imagine that you love me; And after all is said and done, To think that I'm the lucky one, I can't believe that you're in love with me.
