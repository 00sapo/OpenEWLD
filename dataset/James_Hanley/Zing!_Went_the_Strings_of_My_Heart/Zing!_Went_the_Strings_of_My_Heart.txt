Dear, when you smiled at me I heard a melody, It haunted me from the start; Something inside of me Started a symphony, Zing! Went The Strings Of My Heart. Strings Of My Heart. Your eyes made skies seem blue again, What else could I do again, But keep repeating through again "I love you, love you!"'Twas like a breath of Spring, I heard a robin sing, About a nest set apart; All nature seemed to be In perfect harmony,stili re- cali the thrill,_ I guess I ai- ways will,_ I hope 'twill never depart; Dear, with your lips to mine, A rhapsody divine.
