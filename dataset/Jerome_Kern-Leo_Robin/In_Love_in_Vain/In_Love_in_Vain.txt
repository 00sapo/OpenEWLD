It's on.y human for anyone to want to be in love, But who wants to be in love in vain? At night you hang around the house and eat you heart out, and cry your eyes out, and wrack you brain. You sit and wonder why anyone as wonderful as she (he) should cause you such misery and pain. I thought that I would be in heaven, but I'm only up a tree, cause it's just my luck to be in love in vain. It's only vain.I thought that I'd have easy sailing but instead, I'm all at sea,
