There's a pretty spot in Ireland I always claim for my land, where the fairies and the blarney will my never never die. It's the land of the shillalah My heart goes back there daily to the girl I left behind me when we kissed and said goodbye. Where dear old Shannon's flowing, where the three leaved shamrock grows Where my heart is I am going, To my little Irish rose. And the moment that I meet her, With a hug and kiss I'll greet her, For there's not a colleen sweeter, where the River Shannon flows. Sure noSure no letter I'll be mailing For soon I will be sailing and I'll bless the ship that takes me to dear old Erins shore. Then I'll settle down for ever I'll leave the old sod never and I'll whisper to my sweetheart "come and take my name As thore."
