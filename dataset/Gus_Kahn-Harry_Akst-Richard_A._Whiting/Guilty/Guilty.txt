Is it a sin is it a crime loving you dear like I do? If it's a crime then I'm guilty guilty of loving you maybe I'm wrong dreaming of you dreaming the lonely night thru' If it's a crime then I'm guilty guilty of loving you What can I do what can I say after I've taken the blame? you say you're through you'll go your way but I'll always feel the same maybe I'm right maybe I'm wrong loving you dear like I do If it's a crime then I'm guilty guilty of loving you.
