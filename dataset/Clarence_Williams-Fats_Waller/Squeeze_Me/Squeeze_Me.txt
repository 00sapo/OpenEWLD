Baby you've been doggone sweet to me, Baby you're the only one I see. You know I need but you, cos' you're my gal; You love me like no one can. Something 'bout you I can't resist, when you kiss me, momma, I stay kissed. Oh. baby, squeeze me and squeeze me again; Oh, honey, don't stop, till I tell you when. Now, baby, squeeze me and kiss me some more, Just like you did before. Your baby cupid is standing close by, Oh, momma don't let your sweet baby cry. Just pick me up on your knee, I just get so, you know, when you squeeze me. Oh, momma, you squeeze me.
