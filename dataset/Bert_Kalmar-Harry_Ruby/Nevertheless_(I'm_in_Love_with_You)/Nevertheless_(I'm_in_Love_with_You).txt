Maybe I'm right, and maybe I'm wrong, And maybe I'm weak and maybe I'm strong but Nevertheless I'm in love with you Maybe I''ll win and maybe I'll lose, and maybe I'm in, for cryin' the blues but Nevertheless, I'm in love with you. Somehow, I know at a glance the terrible chances I'm taking: fine at the start, thern lefr with a heart that is break ing Maybe I'll live a life of regret and maybe I'll give much more than I'll get; but Nevertheless I'm in love with you
