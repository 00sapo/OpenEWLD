Should auld acquaintance be forgot, and never brought to mind? Should auld acquaintance be forgot and days of Auld Lang Syne, For Auld Lang Syne, my dear, For Auld Lang Syne, We'll take a cup of kindness yet, For Auld Lang Syne We twa' ha'e ran aboor the brae, and pu'd the Gowans fine. We've wandered mony a weary foot sin Auld Lang Syne. For Auld Lang Syne, my dear, For Auld Lang Syne, we'll take a cup of kindness yet, for Auld Lang Syne.
