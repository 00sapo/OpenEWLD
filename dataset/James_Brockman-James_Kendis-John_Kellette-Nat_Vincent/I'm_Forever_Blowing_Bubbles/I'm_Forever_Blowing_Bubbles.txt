I'm dreaming dreams I'm scheming schemes I'm building castles high they're born anew their days are few just like a sweet butterfly and as the daylight is dawning they come again in the morning I'm forever blowing bubbles pret ty bubbles in the air they fly so high nearly reach the sky then like my dreams they fade and die Fortunes always hiding I've looked evry where I'm for ever blowing bubblespretty bubbles in the air.When shadows creep when I'm, asleep to lands of hope I stray then at daybreak when I awake my bluebird flutters away Happiness you seem so near me happiness come forth and cheer me
