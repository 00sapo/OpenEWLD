Easy Street, I'd love to live on Easy Street. Nobody works on Easy Street. Just sit around all day, just sit and play the horses. Life is sweet for folks that live on Easy Street. No weekly payments you must meet that makes your hair turn gray. When oppor tunity comes knockin' you just keep on with your rockin' 'cause you know your fortune's made. And if the sun makes you perspire there's a man that you can hire to plant trees so you can have shade on Easy street, I'm telling ev'ry one I meet If I could live on Easy Street I wouldn't want no job today. so please go 'way.
