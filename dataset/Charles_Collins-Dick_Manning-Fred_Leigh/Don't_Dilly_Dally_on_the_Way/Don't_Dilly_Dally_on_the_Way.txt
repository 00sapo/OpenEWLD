My old man said "follow the van d0n't dilly dally on the way Off went the cart with the home packed in it I walked behind with my old cock linnet But I dillied and dallied dallied and dillied Lost the van and don't know where to roam I stopped on the way to have the old halfquartern and I can't find my way home.
