Picture you up on my knee just tea for two and two for tea just me for you and you for me alone Nobody near us to see us or hear us no friends or relations on weekend vacations, we wont have it known dear that we own a telephone dear Day will break and you'll awake and start to bake a sugar cake for me to take for all the boys to see we will raise a family a boy for you a girl for me oh cant you see how happy we would be?
