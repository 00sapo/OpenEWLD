When you wore a tulip a sweet yellowtulip and I wore a big red rose when you caressed me Twas then heaven blessed me what a blessing noone knows you made life cheery when you called me deary twas down where the blue grass grows your lips were sweeter than julep when you wore that tulip and I wore a big red rose.
