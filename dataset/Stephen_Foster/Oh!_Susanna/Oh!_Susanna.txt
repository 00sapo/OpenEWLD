I come from Alabama wid a banjo on my knee, I'm gwan to Lousiana, My Atrue love for to see. It rained all night the day I left, De weather it was dry, De sun so hot I froze to death, Susanna, don't you cry. Oh! Susanna, Oh! don't you cry for me. I've come from Alabama, wid my banjo on my knee.I had a dream the other night when ev'ry thing was still. I dreamed I saw Susanna dear coming down the hill. The buckwheat cake was in her mouth, The tear was in her eye. says I "I'm coming from the south Susanna, don't you cry." Oh! Susanna Oh! don't you cry for me. I'vecome from Alabama wid my banjo on my knee.
