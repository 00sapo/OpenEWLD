Stars shining bright above you, Night breezes seem to whisper, "I love you." Birds singing in the sycamore tree, "Dream a little dream of me." Say "nightynight" and kiss me; Just hold me tight and tell me you'll miss me. While I'm alone and blue as can be Dream a little dream of me. Stars fading, but I linger on, dear, Still craving your kiss; I'm longing to linger till dawn, dear Just saying this: Sweet dreams 'til sunbeams find you, Sweet dreams that leave all worries behind you; But in your dreams, whatever they be, Dream a little dream of me.
