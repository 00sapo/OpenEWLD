Those happy hours I spent with you, that lovely after glow, most of all I MISS YOU SO. Your sweet caresses, each rendezvous, your voice so soft and low, most of all I MISS YOU SO. You once filled mu heart with no regrets, no fears, now you'll find my heart fill'd to the top with tears. I'll always love you and want you too, how much you'll never know, most of all I MISS YOU SO. SO.Once you promised me we'd never part my dear, now I long to see the day I'll find you near.
