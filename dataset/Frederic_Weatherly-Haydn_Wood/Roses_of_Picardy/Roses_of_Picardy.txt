She is watching by the poplars, Colinette with the sea blue eyes. She is watching and longingand waiting, Where the long white roadway lies. And a song stirs in the silence, As the wind in the boughs above. She listens and starts and trembles, "Tis the first little song of love. Roses are shining in Picardy, in the hush of the silver dew, Roses are flow'ring in Pi cardy, but there's never a rose like you! And the roses will die with the summertime, and our roads may be far apart. But there's one rose that dies not in Picardy! "tis the rose that I keep in my heart!
