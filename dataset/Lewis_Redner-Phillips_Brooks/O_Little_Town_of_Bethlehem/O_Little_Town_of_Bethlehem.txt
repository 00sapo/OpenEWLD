O little town of Bethlehem, How still we see thee lie; above the deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by: Yet in thy dark streets shineth The everlasting Light; The hopes and fears of all the years Are met in Thee tonight.For Christ is born of Malentry; And gathered all above, While mortals sleep the angels keep Their watch of wond'ring love. O morning stars together Proclaim the ho;y birth; And praises sing to God, the King, And peace to men on earth.How silenly, how sily, The wondrous gift is giv'n So God imparts to human hearts The blessing of His heav'n. No ear may hear His coming, But in this world of sin, Where meek souls will receive Him still, The dear Christ enters in.
