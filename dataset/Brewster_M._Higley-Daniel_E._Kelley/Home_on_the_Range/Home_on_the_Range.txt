1. Oh give me a home where the buffalo roam, Where the deer and the antelope play Where never is heard a discouraging word, And the skies are not cloudy all day. Home, home on the range, Where the deer and the antelope play; Where never is heard a discouraging word, And the skies are not cloudy all day.2. Oh give me a land where the bright diamond sand, Throws its light from the glittering stream, Where glideth along the selgraceful white swan, Like the maid in her heavenly dreams.3. Oh give me a gale of the Solomon vale, Where the life streams with buoyancy flow, On the banks of the Beaver, where dom if ever, Any poisonous herbage doth grow.4. How often at night when the heavens were bright, With the light of the twinkling stars, Have I stood there amazed, and asked as I gazed, If their glory exceeds that of ours.5. I love the bright flow'rs in this bright land of ours, I love the wild curlew's shrill scream; The bluffs and white rocks, and antelope flocks, That graze on the mountains so green.6. The air is so pure and the breezes so fine, the zephyrs so balmy and bright, That I would not exchange my home here to range, For- ever in azures so bright.
