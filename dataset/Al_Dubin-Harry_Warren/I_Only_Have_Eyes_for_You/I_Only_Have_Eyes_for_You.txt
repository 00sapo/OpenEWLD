My love must be a kind a blind love, I can't see anyone but you. And dear, I wonder if you find love An optical illusion too? Are the stars out tonight? I don't know if it's cloudy or bright, 'Cause I only have eyes for you, dear The moon may be high, but I can't see a thing in the sky 'Cause I only have eyes for you. I don't know if we're in a garden, Or on a crowded avenue. You are here, so am I. Maybe millions of people go But they all disappear from view, And I only have eyes for you.
