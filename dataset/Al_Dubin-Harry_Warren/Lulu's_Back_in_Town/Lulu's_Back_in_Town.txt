Gotta get my old tuxedo pressed. Gotta sew a button on my vest. 'Cause tonight i"ve got to look my best. Lulu's back in town. You can tell all my pets. All my blondes and brunettes Mister Otis regrets that he won't be around. Better tell the mail man not to call. I ain't coming back until the fall. And I may not come back home at all. Lulu's back in town.Gotta get a half a buck somewhere. Gotta shine my shoes and slick my hair. Gotta get myself a boutonaire. Lulu's back in town.
