The stars are gonna twinkle and shine this evening about a quarter to nine my lovin I know I won't be late cause at half past eight I'm gonna hurry there I'll be waiting where the lane begins waiting for you on needles and pins and then the world is gonna be mine this evening about a quarter to ninearms are gonna tenderly twine around you about a quarter to nine
