Ev'ry kiss, ev'ry hug seems to act just like a drug, you're get ting to be a habit with me. Let me stay in your arms, I'm addicted to your charms, you're get ting to be a habit with me. I used to think your love was something that I could take or leave a lone, but now I couldn't do without my supply, I need you for my own. Oh I can't break away, I must have you ev 'ry day; as regularly as coffee or tea. You've got me in your clutches and I can't get free; you're getting to be a habit with me. (can't break it!) You're getting to be a habit with me. Ev'ry getting to be a habit with me.
