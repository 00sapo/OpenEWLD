In the shadows let me come and sing to you Let me dream a song that I can bring to you Take me in your arms and let me cling to you let me linger long let me live my song In the winter let me bring the spring to you let me feel that I mean ev'rything to you Loves old song will be new In the shadows when I come and sing to you.
