You may not be an angel, 'cause angels are so few. But until the day that one comes along I'll string along with you. I'll sing my song to you. For ev'ry little fault that you have Say, I've got three or four. The human little faults you do have just make me love you more. You may not be an angel, but still I'm sure you'll do. So until the day that one comes along I'll string along with you.I'm looking for an angel to sing my love song to. And until the day that one comes along
