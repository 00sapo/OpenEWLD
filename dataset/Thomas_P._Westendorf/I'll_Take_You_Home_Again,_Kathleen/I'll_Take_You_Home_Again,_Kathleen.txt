I'll take you home again Kathleen across the ocean wild and wide to where your heart has ever been since first you were my bonny bride the roses all have left your cheek I've watched them fade away and die your voice is sad when e'er you speak and tears bedim your loving eyes Oh I will take you back Kathleen to where your heart will feel no pain and when the fields are fresh and green I'll take you to your home
