You're just too marvelous, too marvelous for words, like glorious, glamorous, and that old standby amorous. It's all too wonderful, I'll never find the words, that say enough, tell enough I mean they just aren't swell enough. You're much too much, and just too very, very! To ever be in Webster's Dictionary. And so I'm borrowing a love song from the birds, to tell you that you're marvelous too marvelous for words. You're words.
