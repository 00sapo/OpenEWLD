You promised me green grass, not to tell what you heard whispering grass say! you cant keep your word. keep your word Why do you whisper green grass? why tell the trees what aint so? whispering grass the treesdont have to know No, No, Shy tell them all your secrets? who kissed there long ago whispering grass the trees dont need to know Dont you tell it to the breeze cause she will tell the birds and bees and ev'ryone will know because you told the blabbering trees, Yes, you told them once before Its no secret any more why tell them all the old things? They're buried under the snow whispering grass dont tell the trees cause the trees dont need to know.
