Our romance won't end on a sorroful note. Though by tomorrow you're gone The song is ended but as the songwriter wrote, The melody lingers on. They may take you from me, I'll miss your fond caress. But though they take you from me I'll still possess. The way you wear your hat The way you sip your tea The mem'ry of all that No, no they can't take that away from me The way your smile just beams The way you sing off key The way you haunt my dreams No, no they can't take that a way from me We may never never meet again on the bumpy road to love Still I'll always, always keep the mem'ry of The way you hold your knife The way we danced till three The way you chang'd my life, No, no you can't take that a way from me No they can't take that away from me! The way you wear your hat, me!
