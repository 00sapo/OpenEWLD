When I want a melody lilting thru the house, Then I want a melody by Strauss! It laughs! It sings! The world is in rhyme, Swinging to three quarter time. Let the "Danube" flow along And the "Fledermaus!" Keep the wine and give me song by Strauss! By Jo! By Jing! "By Strauss" is the thing! So I say to hachacha Heraus! Just give me a oompahpah By Strauss! When I want a Strauss!
