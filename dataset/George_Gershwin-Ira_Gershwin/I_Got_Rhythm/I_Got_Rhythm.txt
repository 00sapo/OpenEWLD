Days can be sunny, With never a sigh, Don't need what money can buy. Birds in the tree sing their dayful of song, Why shouldn't we sing along? I'm chipper all the day, Happy with my log. How do I get that way? Look at what I've got; I got rhythm, I got mu sic, my man, who could ask for anything more? I got dai sies In green pastures, I got my man, who could ask for anything more? Old Man Trouble, I Don't mind him, You won't find him 'Round my door. I got starlight, I got sweet dreams, I got my man Who could ask for a ny thing more, Who could ask for anything more? more?
