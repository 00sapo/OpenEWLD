Fascinating rhythm You've got me on the go! fascinating rhythm I'm all a quiver what a mess you're making! the neighbors want to know why I'm always shaking just like a flivver each morning I get up with the sun (Start a hopping never stopping) to find at night no work has been done I know that once it didn't matter but now you're doing wrong when you start to patter I'm so unhappy Won't you take a day off? decide to run along somewhere far away off and make it snappy Oh how I long to be the man I used to be! Fascinating rhythm Oh wont you stop picking on me!
