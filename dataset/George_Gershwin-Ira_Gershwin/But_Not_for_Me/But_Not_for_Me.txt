They're writing songs of love, But not for me. A lucky star's above, But not for me. With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of grey Than any Rus sian play Could guarantee. I was a fool to fall And get that way; Heighho! Alas! and al so, Lack a day! Although I cant dismiss the mem'ry of his kiss I guess he's not for me.
