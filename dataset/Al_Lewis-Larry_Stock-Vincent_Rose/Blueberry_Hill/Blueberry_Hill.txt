I found my thrill On Blueberry Hill On Blueberry Hill When I found you. The moon stood still On Blueberry Hill. And lingered til my dreams came true. The wind in the willow played Love's sweet melody; But all of those vows we made were nev-er to be. Tho' we're apart. Tou're part of me still For you were my thrill On Blueberry Hill. I found my Hill.
