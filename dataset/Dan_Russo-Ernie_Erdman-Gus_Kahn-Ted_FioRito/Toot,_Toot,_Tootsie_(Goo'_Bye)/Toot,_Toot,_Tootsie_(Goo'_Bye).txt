Yesterday I heard a lover sigh, "Goodbye oh, me oh my" Seven times he got aboard his train And seven times he hurried back to kiss his love again, and tell her: Toot, Toot, Tootsie goodbye! Toot, Toot, Tootsie, don't cry, The choochoo train that takeS me, Away from you no words can tell how sad it makes me, Kiss me Tootsie, and then, Do it over again Watch for the mail, I'll never fail, If you don't get a letter then you'll know I'm in jail, Tut tut Tootsie, don't cry Toot, Toot Tootsie, goodbye.
