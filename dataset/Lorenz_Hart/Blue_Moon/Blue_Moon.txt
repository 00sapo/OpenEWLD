Blue moon, you saw me standing alone without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own. Blue moon, you knew just what I was there for. You heard me saying a pray'r for someone I really could care for. And then there suddenly appeared before me the only one my arms could ever hold. I heard somebody whisper, "Please adore me" and when I looked, the moon had turned to gold! Blue moon, now I'm no longer alone, without a dream in my heart, without a love of my own.
