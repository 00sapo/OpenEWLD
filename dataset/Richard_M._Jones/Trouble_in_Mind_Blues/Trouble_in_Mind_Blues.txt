Trouble in mind, at I'm blue, but I wont be blue always; 'Cos the sun gonna shine on my back door life somday. I'm gonna lay my head on a lonesome rail road line, And let the Two that Nine teen Lord, I'm pacify my mind.I'm all alone the midnite, and my lamp is burnin' low; Never had so much trouble in amy before. I'm gonna lay my head on the lonesome railroad track, But when I hear na whistle, gonna pull it back.I'm goin' down to river, Take along my rocking chair; If the blues don't leave me, I'll rock way from here. Trouble in mind, I'm blue, but I wont be blue always. 'Cos the sun gonshine on my back door some day.
