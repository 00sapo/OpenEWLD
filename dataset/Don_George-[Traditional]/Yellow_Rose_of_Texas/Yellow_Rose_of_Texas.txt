There's a yellow rose in Texas that I am going to see Nobody else could miss her not half as much as me she cried so when I left her It like to broke my heart and if I ever find her we never more will part she's the sweetest little rosebud that Texas ever knew her eyes are bright as diamonds they sparkle like the dew you may talk about your Clementine and sing of Rosalee but the yellow rose of Texas it the only girl for me Where the me.Rio Grande is flowing and starry skies are bright She walks along the river in the quiet summer night I know that she remembers when,we parted long ago I promised to return and not to leave her so
