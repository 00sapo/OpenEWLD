Alone from night to night you'll find me, Too weak to break the chains that bind me, I need no shackles to remind me I'm just a pris'ner of love. For one command I stand and wait now, From one who's master of my fate now, I can't escape for it's too late now, I'm just a pris'ner of love. What's the good of my caring if someone is sharing those arms with me? Although she has another I can't have another for I'm not free. She's in my dreams awake or sleeping Upon my knees to her I'm creeping; My very life is in her keeping I'm just a pris'ner of love
