Theres music on the air there's shouting evry where as the boys go marching by We hear the tramp of feet along the crowded street and our hearts are beating high! they pass us line on line my word but they look fine, see the soldiers straight and tall the sailor lads so true the AirForce boys iun blue, how we love them one and all the Army the Navy and the Air Force have made old Eng lands name Our soldiers and Sailors and our Air men have always played the game they're steady and true and strong and rea dy to do and die and dare the Army the Navy and the Air Force when the call comes they'll be there. The there.The bands begin to play A martial tune so gay and the rolling drums we hear We see them wave on wave so trusty and so brave how the people shout and cheer altho the world may say Old Eng lands had her day they will find their dreams are vain so let them all be told that what we have we hold we can fight and win again.
