I'm always chasing rainbows watching clouds drifting by my schemes are just like all my dreams ending in the sky Some fellows look and find the sunshine I always look and find the rain some fellows make a winning sometime I never even make a gain, believe me I'm always chasing rainbows waiting to find a little bluebird in vain.
