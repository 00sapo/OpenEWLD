I want to be happy, but I won't be happy, Till I make you happy too. Life's really worth living, When we are nirth giving; Why can't I give some to you? When skies are gray and you say you are blue, I'll send the sun smiling through. I want to be happy, but I won't be happy, Till I make you happy, too. too.
