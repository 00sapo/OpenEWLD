Way down on the levee in old Al are abamy There's daddy and mammy there's Ephriam and Sammy, on a moon light night you can find them all, While they are waitin' the banjos are syncopatin'. What's that they're sayin' What's that they're sayin? If While they keep playin' you'll hummin' and swayin' It's the good ship Robert E Lee that's come to carry the cotton away, Watch them shufflin' along See them shufflin' along Go take your best gal real pal, Go doen to the levee, I said to the levee and Join that shufflin' throngHear that music and song It's simply great mate, Waitin' on the levee, Waitin' for the Robert E. Lee Thewhistles are blowin' the smokestacks showin' The ropes they are throwin' excuse me, I'm goin' To the place where all is harmonious, Even the preacher, he is the danceing teacher Have you been down there? Were you around there? you ever go there always be found there, Why doggone, here comes my baby On the good old Robert E. Lee.
