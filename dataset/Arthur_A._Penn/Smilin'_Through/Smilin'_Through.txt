There's a little brown road windin' over the hill To a little white cot by the sea; There's a little green gate At whose trelis I wait, While two eyes o' blue Come smilin' through At me! There's a gray lock or two in the brown of the hair, There's some silver in mine, too I see; But in all the long years When the clouds brought their tears, Those two eyes o' blue Kept smilin' through At me! And ifever I'm left in this world on my own, I shall wait for my call patiently, And if heaven be kind I shall wait there to find, Those two eyes o' blue Come smilin through At me.
