I can't begin to tell you, how much you mean to me. My world would end if ever we were through. I can't begin to tell you how happy I would be, If I could speak my mind like others do. I make such pretty speaches whenever we're apart, but when your near the words I choose refuse to leave my heart. So take the sweetest phrases the work has ever known, and make believe I've said them all to you. I you.
