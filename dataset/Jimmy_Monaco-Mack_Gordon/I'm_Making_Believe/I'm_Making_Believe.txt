I'm making believe that your in my arms Tho' I know you're so far away, Making be lieve I'm talking to you, Wish you could hear what I say And here in the goom of my lonely room We'redancing like we used to do. Making believe is just another way of dreaming, So till my dreams come true, I'll whisper goodnight, Turn out the light, and kiss my pillow Making believe it's you. I'm you.
