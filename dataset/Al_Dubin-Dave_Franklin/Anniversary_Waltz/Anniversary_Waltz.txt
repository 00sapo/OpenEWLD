We just discovered each other tonight when the lights were low one dance led up to another and now I cant let you go so Tell me I may always dance the anniversary waltz with you tell me this is real romance an anniversary dream come true let this be the anthem to our future years to millions of smiles and a few little tears May I always listen to the anniversary waltz with you you.
