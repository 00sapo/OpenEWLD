I took one look at you, That's all I meant to do; and then my heart stood still!! My feet could step and walk, my lips could move and talk, and yet my heart stood still! Though not a single word was spoken, I could tell you knew, that unfelt clasp of hands told me so well you knew. I never lived at all until the thrill of that moment when My Heart Stood Still! Still!
