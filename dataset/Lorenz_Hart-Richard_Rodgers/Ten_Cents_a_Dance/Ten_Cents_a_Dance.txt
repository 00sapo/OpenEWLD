Ten cents a dance; That's what they pay me. Gosh, how they weigh me down! Ten cents a dance, Pansies and rough guys, Tough guys who tear my gown! Seven to midnight I hear drums, Loudly the saxophone blows, Trumpets are tearing my eardrums. Customers crush my toes. Sometimes I think I've found my hero But it's a queer rommance, All that you need is a ticket; Come on, big boy, ten cents a dance!
