Fools rus in, so here I am very glad to be unhappy; I can't win, but her I am, more than gald to be unhappy. Unrequited love's a bore, and I've got it pretty bad. But for someone you adore, it's a pleasure to be sad. Like a straying baby lamb, with no mammy and no pappy, I'm so unhappy, but oh, so glad!
