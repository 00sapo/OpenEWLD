The sleepless nights, the daily fights, the quick tobogan when you reach the heights; I miss the kisses and I miss the bites, I wish I were in love again! The broken dates, the endless waits, the lovely loving and the hateful hates, the conversation with the flying plates, I wish I were in love again! No more pain, no more strain. Now I'm sane, but I would rather be gaga! The pulled out fur of cat and cur the fine mismating of a him and her, I've learned my lesson, but I wish I were in love again! The gain!
