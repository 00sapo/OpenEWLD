There's a small hottel with a wishing well; I wish that we were there together There's a bridal suite; one room bright and neat, complete for us to share together Looking thru the window you can see a distant steeple not a sign of people who wants people? When the steeple bell says "Good night sleep well we'll thank the small hotel We'll creep into our little shell and we will thank the small hotel together
