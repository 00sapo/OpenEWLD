I've wined and dined on mulligan stew and never wished for turkey, As I hitched and hiked and grifted, too, from Maine to Albuquerque. Alas, I missed the BeauxArts Ball and what is twice as sad, I was never at a party where they honored Noel Ca'ad. But social circles spin too fast for me. My Hobohemia is the place to be. 1.  I get too hungry for dinner at eight, I like the theatre, but never come late. I never bother with people I hate, That's why the lady is a tramp. I don't like crap games with Barons and Earls, Won't go to Harlem in ermine and pearls. Won't dish the dirt with the rest of the girls, That's why the lady is a tramp. 1. I like the free fresh wind in my hair, Life without care. I'm broke, it's oke. Hate California, It's cold and it's damp, That's why the lady is a tramp.2. I go to Coney, the beach is divine. I go to ball games, the bleachers are fine. I follow Winchell and read ev'ry line. I like a prize fight that isn't a fake, I love the rowing on Central Park Lake. I go to op'ra and stay wide awake, 2. I like the green grass under my shoes. What can I lose? I'm flat, that's that. I'm all alone when I lower my lamp,
