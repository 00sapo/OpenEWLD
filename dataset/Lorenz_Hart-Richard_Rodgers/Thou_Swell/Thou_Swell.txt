Thou swell! Thou witty! Thou sweet! Thou grand! Wouldst kiss me pretty? Wouldst hold my hand? both thine eyes are cute too; what they do to me. Hear me holler I choose a sweet lolapaloosa in thee. I'd feel so rich in a hut for two; two rooms and kitchen I'm sure would do; give me just a plot of, not a lot of land, And thou swell! Thou witty! Thou grand!
