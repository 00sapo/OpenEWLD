Once I laughed when I heard you saying that I'd be playing solitaire, uneasy in my easy chair, It never entered my mind. Once you told me I was mistaken that I'd awaken with the sun and order orange juice for one, it never entered my mind. You have what I lack myself, and now I even have to scratch my back myself. Once you warned me that if you scorned me I'd sing the maiden's pray'r again, and wish that you were there again to get into my hair again It never entered my mind, mind,
