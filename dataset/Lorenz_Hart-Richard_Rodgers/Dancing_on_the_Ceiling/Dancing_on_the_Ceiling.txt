He dances overhead, on the ceiling near my bed, in my sight through the night. I try to hide in vain under neath my counterpane there's my love, up above. I whisper "Go away my lover, it's not fair." But I'm so grateful to discover he's still there. I love my ceilling more since it is a dancing floor just for my love.
