My romance doesn't have to have a moon in the sky. My romance doesn't need a blue lagoon standing by; no month of May no twinkling stars, no hide away, no soft guitars. My romance doesn't need a castle rising in Spain, nor a dance to a constantly surprising refrain. Wide awake I can make my most fantastic dreams come true; My romance doesn't need a thing but you.
