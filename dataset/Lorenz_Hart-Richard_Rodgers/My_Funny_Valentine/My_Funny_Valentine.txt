My funny Valentine, sweet comic Valentine, you make me smile with my heart. Your looks are laughable, unphotographable, yet, you're my fav'rite work of art. Is your figure less than Greek; is you mouth a little weak when you open it to speak, are you smart? But don't change a hair for me, not if you care for me, stay, little valentine, stay! Each day is Valentine's day.
