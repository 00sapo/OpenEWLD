Isn't it romantic? Music in the night, a dream that can be heard. Isn't it romantic? Moving shadows write the olddest magic word. I hear the breezes playing in the trees above. While all the world is saying you were meant for love. Isn't it romantic? Merely to be young on such a night as this? Isn't it romantic? ev'ry note that's sung is like a lovers kiss. Sweet symbols in the moonlight, do you mean that I will fall in love per chance? Isn't it romance? Isn't it romanmance?
