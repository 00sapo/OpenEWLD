I didn't know what time it was, then I met you. Oh what a lovely time it was, how sublime it was too. I didn't know wat day it was, you held my hand, warm like the month of May it was, and I'll say it was grand. Grand to be alive, to be young, to be mad to be yours alone. Grand to see your face, feel your touch, hear your voice say I'm all your own. I didn't know what year it was, life was no prize. I wanted love and here it was shining out of your eyes. I'm wise and I know what time it is now. now.
