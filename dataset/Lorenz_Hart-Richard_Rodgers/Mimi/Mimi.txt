My left shoe's on my right foot, my right shoes on my left. Oh, listen to me Mimi, of reason I'm bereft. The buttons of my trousers are buttoned to my vest. Oh, listen to me Mimi, mere passions in my breast!. Mimi, you funny little good for nothing Mimi, am I the guy? Mimi you sunny little honey of a Mimi I'm aiming high. Mimi you've got me sad and dreamy You could free me if you'd see me. Mimi You know I'd like to have a little son of a Mimi by and by.
