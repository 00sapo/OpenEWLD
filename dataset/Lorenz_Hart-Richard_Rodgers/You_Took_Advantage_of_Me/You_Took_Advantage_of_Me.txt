I'm a sentamental sap that's all. What's the use of trying not to fall? I have no will, you've made your kill 'Cause you took advantage of me! I'm just like an apple on a bough, And you're gonnashake me down somehow, So what's the use you've cooked my goose 'Cause you took advantage of me! I'm so hot and bothered that I don't know My elbow from my ear; I suffer something awful each time you go And much worse when you're near. Here I am with all my bridges burned, Just a babe in arms where you're concerned, So lock the doors and call me yours 'Cause you took advantage of me! me!
