I don't know what day it is, Or if it's dark or fair; Somehow, that's just the way it is, And i don't really care. I go to this or that place, I seem alive and well; My head is just a hat place, My breast and empty shell! And I've a faded dream to sell. All alone, all at sea! Why does nobody care for me, When there's no love to hold my love? Why is my heart so frail, Like a ship without a sail? Out on the ocean, sailors can use a chart; I'm on the ocean guided by just a lonely heart. Stillalone, still at sea! Still there's no one to care for me, When there's noone to hold my hand. Life is a loveless tale; For a ship without a sail. sail.
