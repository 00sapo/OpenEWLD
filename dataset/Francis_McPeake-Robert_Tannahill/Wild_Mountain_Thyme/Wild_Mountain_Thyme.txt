1.Oh, the summer time is coming, And the trees are sweetly blooming, And the wild mountain thyme Grows around the blooming heather. Will ye go, lassie go? And we'll all go together to pluck wild mountain thyme, All around the blooming heather. Will ye go, lassie go?2.I will build my love a bower, Near yon pure and crystal fountain, And on it I will bring All the flowers of the mountain.3.If my true love she won't come, I would never find another, To pluck wild mountain thyme All around the blooming heather.4.Oh, the summer time is coming, And the trees are sweetly blooming, And the wild mountain thyme Grows around the blooming heather.
