Oh, say! le us fly dear. Where, kid? to the sky, dear. Oh, you flying machine! Jump in Miss Josephine. Ship Ahoy! Oh, joy! what a feeling. Where, boy? In the ceiling. Ho, high, hoopla! we fly to the sky so high. Come Josephine in my flying machine, Going up, she goes! up, she goes! Balance yourself like a bird on a beam, In the air she goes, there she goes! Up, up, a little bit higher. Oh, my! the moon is on fire. Come, Josephine in my flying machine, Going up, all on, Goodbye! bye!One two, now we're off dear Say you, pretty soft dear. Whoa! dear don't hit the moon. No dear, not yet but soon. YOu for me, Oh Gee! you're a fly kid. Not me, I'm a sky kid Gee! I'm up in the air about you for fair.
