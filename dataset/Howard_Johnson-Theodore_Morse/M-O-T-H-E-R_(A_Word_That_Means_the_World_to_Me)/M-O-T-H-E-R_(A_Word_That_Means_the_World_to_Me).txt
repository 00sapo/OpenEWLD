"M" is for the million things she gave me, "O" means only that she's growing old, "T" is for the tears she shed to save me, "H" is for her heart as pure as gold, "E" is for her eyes, with lovelight shining, "R" means right and right she'll always be, Put them all together they spell "MOTHER," A word that means the world to me. me. The world to me.
