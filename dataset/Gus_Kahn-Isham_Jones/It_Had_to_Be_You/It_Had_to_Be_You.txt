Why do I do just as you say, why must I just give you your way? Why do I sigh, why don't I try to forget? It must have been that something lovers call fate. Kept on saying I had to wait. I saw them all just couldn't fall 'til we met. It had to be you it had to be you, I wandered around and finally found the somebody who could make me be true could make me be blue and even be glad just to be sad thinking of you. Some others I've seen, might never be mean might never be cross or try to be boss but they would'nt do For nobody else gave me a thrill with all your faults I love you still. It had to be you wonderful you had to be you. It had to be you, had to be you.Seems like dreams like I always had, could be, should be making me glad. Why am I blue? it's up to you to explain. I'm thinking maybe, baby I'll go away, someday some way you'll come and say. "It;s you I need, And you'll be pleading in vain.
