Ev'rybody hand in hand, Swnigin' down the lane, Ev'rybody feelin' grand, Swingin' down the lane, That's the time I miss the bliss that we might have known, Nights like this when I'm all alone; when the moon is on the rise, Honey, I'm so blue, Watshin' lovers makin' eyes, Like we used to do, When the moon is on the wane still I'm waitin' all in vain, Should be swingin' down the lane with you Ev'rybody you.
