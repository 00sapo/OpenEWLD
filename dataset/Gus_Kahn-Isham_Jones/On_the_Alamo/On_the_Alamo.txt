Where the moon swings low On the Alamo In a garden fair, where roses grow. In the tender light of the summer night. I can see her wander to and fro For she said I'll wait By the golden gate On the night I said, "I love you so." and in all my dream it seems, I go Where the moon swings low On the Alamo. Where the moon swings Alamo.
