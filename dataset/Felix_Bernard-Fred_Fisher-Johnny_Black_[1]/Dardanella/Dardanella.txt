Down beside the Dardanella Bay, Where Oriental breezes play, There lives a lonesome maid, Armenian By the Dardanelles with glowing eyes, She looks across the seas and sighs, And weaves her love spell so Sirenian Soon I shall return to Turkestan I will ask for her heart and hand: Oh! sweet Dardanella, I love your harem eyes I'm a lucky fellow to capture such a prize Oh Allah knows, my love for you And he tells you to be true, Dardanel la, Oh hear my sigh My Oriental, Oh! sweet Dardanella prepare the wedding wine There'll be one girl in my harem, when you're mine. We'll build a tent just like the children of the Orient, Oh! sweet Dardanella, my star of love divineWhen the Turkish Sultan saw her eyes, Oh! he was taken by surprise, He said "I'll buy her for my Harem" I just told the Sultan to be nice, She can't be bought for any price, She said to me she couldn't bear him So beneath the Oriental moon, I'll be wooing my love real soon:
