1. 'Round me at twilight come stealing, Shadows of days that are gone; Dreams of the old days revealing Mem'ries of love's golden dawn. Memories, memories, dreams of love so true. O'er the sea of memory I'm drifting back to you. Childhood days, woldwood days, among the birds and bees. You left me alone, but still you're my own! In my beautiful memories.2. Sunlight may teach me forgetting, Noonlight brings thoughts that are new; Twilight brings sighs and regretting Moonlight means sweet dreams of you.
