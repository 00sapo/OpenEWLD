1.I've got a pal. A reg'lar out an outer She's a dear good old gal' I'll tell yer all about 'er. It's many years since we first met, 'Er 'air was then as black as jet, It's Whiter now, but she don't fret, Not my old gal. We've been together now for forty years, An it don't seem a day too much, There ain't a lady livin' in the land As I'd "swop" for my dear old Dutch. There ain't a lady livin' in the land As I'd "swop" for my dear old Dutch.2.I calls 'er Sal, 'Er propper name is Sairer An' yer may find a gal As you'd consider fairer She ain't an angelshe can start Ajawin' till it makes yer smart, She's just a woman bless 'er 'eart, is my old gal!3.Sweet fine old gal, For worlds I wouldn't lose 'er, She's a dear good old gal, An' that's what made me choose 'er. She's stuck to me through thick 'an thin, When luck was out, when luck was in, Ah! what a wife to me she's been, An' what a pal!4.I sees yer Sal Yer pretty ribbons sportin' Many years now, old gal, Since them young days of courtin'. I ain't a coward still I trust When we're to part as part we must, That Death may come and tate me fust To waitmy pal!
