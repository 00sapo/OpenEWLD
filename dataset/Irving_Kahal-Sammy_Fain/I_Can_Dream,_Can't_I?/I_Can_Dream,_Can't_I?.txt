I can see, no matter how near you'll be, You'll never belong to me But I Can Dream, Can't I? Can't I pretend that I'm locked in the bend of your embrace? For dreams are just like wine, And I am drunk with mine. I'm aware my heart is a sad affair There's much disillusion there, But I Can Dream, Can't I? Can't I adore you although we are oceans apart? I can't make you open your heart, But I Can Dream, Can't I? Can't I?
