They were summoned from the hillside, They were called in from the glen, And the Country found them ready At the stirring call for men. Let no tears add to their hardship, As the Soldiers pass along And although your heart is breaking, Make it sing this cheery song. Keep the Homefires burning, While your hearts are yearning, Though your lads are far away They dream of Home, There's a silver lining Through the dark cloud shining, Turn the dark cloud inside out, Till the boys come homeOver seas there came a pleading, "Help a Nation in distress!" And we gave our glorious laddies, Honor made us do no less. For no gallant Son of Freedom To a tyrant's yoke should bend, And a noble heart must answer To the sacred call to "Friend".
