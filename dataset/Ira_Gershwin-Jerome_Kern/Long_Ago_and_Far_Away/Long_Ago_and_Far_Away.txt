Long ago and far away I dreamed a dream on day, And now that dream is here beside me Long the skies were over cast, But now the clouds have passed, You're here at last! Chills run up and down my spine; aladdin's lamp is mine; The dream I dreamed was not denied me. Just one look and then I knew That all I longed for long ago was you.
