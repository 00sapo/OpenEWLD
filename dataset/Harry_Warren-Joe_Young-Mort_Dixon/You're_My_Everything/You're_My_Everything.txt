You're my ev'rything underneath the sun; you're my ev'rything rolled up into one. You're my only dream, my only real reali ty. You're my idea of a perfect personality. You're my ev'rything, ev'rything I need; You're the song I sing and the book I read. You're away beyond belief and just to make it brief, You're my winter, summer, spring, my ev'rything. You're my thing.
