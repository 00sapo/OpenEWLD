Maria͡͡ Elena you're the answer to a prayer. Maria͡͡ E le na can't you see how much I care? To me your voice is like the echo of a sigh, and when you're near my heart can't speak above a sigh. Maria͡͡ Elena say that we will never part, Maria͡͡ Elena take me to your heart. A love like mine is great enough for two. To share this love is really all I ask of you. Mari a͡͡ Elena you.
