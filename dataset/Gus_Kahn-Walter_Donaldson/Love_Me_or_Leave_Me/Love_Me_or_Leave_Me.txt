Love me or leave me or let me be lonely. You wont believe me, and I love you only. I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else. You might find the nighttime the right time for kissing, but nighttime is my time for just reminiscing, regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else. There'll be no one unless that someone is you. I intend to be independ ently blue. I want your love but I don't want to borrow, to have it today and to give back tomorrow, For my love is your love, there's no love for nobody else!!
