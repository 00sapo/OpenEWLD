I wonder where my baby is tonight? I wonder how my baby is tonight? I woner where she's gone, And how she's getting on; I wonder why my baby doesn't write, If she came back I wonder what I'd do? I wonder did she find somebody new; She didn't treat me fair, And tho' I shouldn't care; I wonder where my baby is tonight? I wonder does my baby do the Charleston Charleston I wonder who is teaching her the Charleston Charleston While I sit and sigh, the time goes draggin' by; I'd like to kill the guy that wrote the Charleston Charleston. We parted 'cause I couldn't do the Charleston Charleston She'd still be here if I could do the Charleston Charleston I'm takin' lessons now; I'll win her back somehow I wonder where my baby is tonight. I night.
