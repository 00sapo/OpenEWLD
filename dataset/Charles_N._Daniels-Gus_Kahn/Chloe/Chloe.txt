Chloe! Chloe! Someone callin' no reply, Night shades fallin', hear him sigh, Chloe! Chloe! Empty spaces meet his eyes, Empty arms out=stretched, He's cryin' Through the black of night I got to go where you are If it's wrong or right, I got to go where you are, I'll roam through the dismal swampland searching for you. 'cause if you are lost there, Let me be there too Through the smoke and flame I gotto go where you are, For no place could be too far, where you are. Ain't no chains can bind you, If you live, I'll find you, Love is calling me, I got to go where you are.
