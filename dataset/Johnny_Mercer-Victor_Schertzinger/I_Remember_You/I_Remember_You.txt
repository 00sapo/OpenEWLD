I remember you. You're the one who made my dreams come true a few kisses ago. I remember you. You're the one who said: "I love you, too." I do. Didn't you know? I remember too a distant bell and stars that fell like rain, out of the blue. When my life is through and the angels ask me to recall the thrill of them all, then I shall tell them I remember you. you.
